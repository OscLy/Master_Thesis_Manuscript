\section{Conceptualisation and Initial Design}
The essence of a design process is inherently iterative and exploratory. It takes the form of a cycle of conception, experimentation, evaluation, and refinement. This iterative cycle is fundamental to translating abstract ideas into tangible solutions that meet set goals.
%Within this framework, the development of a mock \gls{TV} for a heart simulator exemplifies the complex interplay of innovation, precision, and adaptability.

At the heart of the design process lies trial and errorâ€”a methodical yet flexible approach that takes the discovery of unexpected challenges and leverages them as opportunities for learning and input. Initial ideas are transformed into preliminary models, serving as the first step in a series of continuous interactions between designing, testing, and iterating.
%This process is characterized by the application of various modeling approaches, each iteration informed by the insights gained from previous attempts and the evolving understanding of the project's objectives.

The dynamic nature of this process sets a strong base to pivot strategies, incorporate new technologies/materials, and adapt to findings in real-time. The design changes throughout this project were not merely reactions to setbacks but were driven by a pursuit of optimization, whether in response to material limitations, fabrication challenges, or new modelling insights.
% Reworking based on these design changes is critical, allowing the prototypes to improve incrementally, each iteration bringing them closer to the optimal balance between theoretical accuracy and practical functionality.


\mynewline
The initial vision of the in-vitro \gls{TV} was formed on reflection of the literature review. It is crucial to consider both the anatomical fidelity required for effective simulation and the technical feasibility of creating a functional model when developing initial concepts which can then be adapted as the project moves forward and firmer boundaries are discovered.

The approach taken was to start prototyping with the simplest design and gradually increase complexity as the project progressed. This allowed for a more systematic exploration of the design, ensuring that each iteration built upon the insights gained from the previous one with respect to all stages of manufacturing. A minimal time investment in preliminary modelling allowed the prototyping process to be refined in tandem. This was essential to finishing with a refined final model, balancing anatomical fidelity with fabrication feasibility and functional performance.

\section{Design Criteria}\label{sec:Design Criteria}
The design criteria were established to guide the development of the mock \gls{TV}. These criteria were informed by the project's objectives, the gaps in the literature, and the technical constraints of the fabrication process.
% \mynewline
The design criteria were as follows:
\begin{fullwidth}
    \newthought{Criterion 1: Anatomical Fidelity}\\ The mock \gls{TV} should precisely resemble the anatomical structure of the \gls{TV}, capturing the key features of the valve's leaflets, annulus and chordae tendineae and, where possible, to account for the variations.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justification: To maintain a realistic simulator, an effort must be made to ensure representative geometry to provide a realistic evaluation tool for medical devices.
    \end{itemize}

    \newthought{Criterion 2: Functional Performance}\label{sec:Functional Performance}\\ The mock \gls{TV} should exhibit the functional characteristics of the \gls{TV}, including the ability to open and close in response to fluid flow, and the capacity to simulate regurgitation simulating the physiological and pathological conditions of a natural \gls{TV}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justification: Without these functional characteristics, the mock valve would be limited in applicability for integration and characterisation of a prosthetic valve device.
    \end{itemize}

    \newthought{Criterion 3: Material Compatibility}\\ The materials used in the fabrication of the mock \gls{TV} should be flexible, durable, and suitable for the intended application, ensuring that the valve can withstand fluid flow and mechanical stresses.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justification: The valve, once integrated into the right heart simulator, will be subjected to continuous fluid flow and mechanical forces over a long period, necessitating the use of materials that can withstand these conditions over a long period.
    \end{itemize}

    \newthought{Criterion 4: Fabrication Feasibility}\\ The design of the mock \gls{TV} should be amenable to the fabrication process, considering the limitations of the 3D printing and moulding techniques used in the project.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justification: Some aspects of \gls{TV} performance depends on biological factors that are difficult to replicate, such as collagen fibre alignment. This design should be able to be fabricated in a way that can be easily replicated and improved upon in the future.
    \end{itemize}
    %While also being a key point to the larger project of the heart simulator the valve should be easily replicated and improved on upon again in the future.
    \newthought{Criterion 5: Scalability and Modifiability}\label{sec:Scalability}\\ The design of the mock \gls{TV} should be scalable, allowing for the creation of multiple valve moulds easily by hot-swapping the scanned and refined \gls{CT} models with varying anatomical features and functional characteristics
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justification: As the overarching project of the right heart simulator progresses past this thesis, the valve should be easily replicated and improved upon again so that future goals can be met.
    \end{itemize}
\end{fullwidth}

\section{Modelling and Design Iterations}

\subsection{Simplified Valve Designs}

\newthought{Flat Valve:}
As illustrated in \cref{fig:flat}, the flat valve was the first to be developed, with the idea being to use it as a basis for developing the complexity. The shape of the leaflets was designed by overlaying images of regurgitant valves from a study which modelled the \gls{TV} at different stages of regurgitation \citeonly{namModelingTricuspidValve2023} in systole normal to the annulus of the valve over a disc in SolidWorks and then drawing a spline aligned with the leaflet shapes.
In later iterations of this basic structure, considerations started to be made for the chordae tendineae, including whether to include them and how. There were two schools of thought on this method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Having the tendineae attached within the mould and casting the part all of the same material.
    \item Casting the valve part without tendineae and then attaching tendineae after being made from another material.
\end{itemize}
It wasn't until outcomes in the prototyping phase, section:\cref{sec:Chord} that this was fully decided on based on experimental results.
%as studies from the literature review \todo{reference} showed how the elastic modulus varied greatly from leaflet to  tendineae.

\newthought{Billowed Valve:}\\
The next layer of complexity for the valve to visually replicate an anatomical valve was adding the billowed effect.
The literature review section:\cref{sec:varpath} showed how in regurgitant valves the annulus dilates, tendineae weaken and the valve develops a partial prolapse, this was reflected in later iterations by creating a revolve feature in SolidWorks in a 'U' shape which was centred within the leaflets (as opposed to the annulus) to overlay the cusp cut on top of.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/billow}
    \caption{Visual representation of regurgitant valve morphological progression \citeonly{namModelingTricuspidValve2023}}
    \label{fig:bill}
\end{figure}
% It was hoped with the added depth to the leaflets in this iteration that the valve would be able to coapt as the cusps began to have more overlap with adjacent leaflets
Later iterations of this model included the chordae tendineae and added extrusions on the leaflet cusps to allow the leaflets to coapt properly; however, as prototyping progressed and the possibility for using a model converted from a \gls{CT} scan grew brighter, the work on the representative models was put on hold.


\subsection{Represenative Valve Designs}

\newthought{Anatomical Valve Model:}\\
While development on the mock valve was progressing, the idea for a more anatomically accurate valve began to look favourable, for it aligned more closely with the project's aims. The idea was to use a \gls{CT} scan of a \gls{TV} and then convert this into a 3D model. There were a few options for this; a software package like Mimics can be used to do it quickly; however, this package is very expensive, or open-source programs like Ostrix. Due to the difficulties in capturing the geometry of tricuspid valves in \gls{CT} and the less user-friendly interface of Osirix, it was decided that a pre-existing model from an online STL repository would be used as a base instead and then refined to fit the project's needs.

With this approach, the traceability of the model is lost, but with confirmation from the designer that it was developed from imaging from a human, it was deemed fit for purpose.

\mynewline
Harnessing the converted model presented many unexpected challenges; this was discovered when initially trying to import the STL model into SolidWorks, and many zero-thickness geometries were present. The main technical issues with this model were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-intersecting faces,
    \item Non-manifold edges
    \item Holes throughout the surface
    \item Inaccuracies in the model
    \item Widely varying leaflet thickness
\end{itemize}
The development of this model had originally been intended to provide educational illustrations of the anatomy, not to be produced physically, so work began to refine it for physical production.

\subsection{Model Refinement}
Several software packages were tried and tested to tackle these issues and get the converted model to a usable state to see which could effectively resolve the problems. The leading software used was Meshlab, Meshmixer, Blender, AutoCAD NetFabb, and SolidWorks.

Meshlab is an open-source software for processing and editing unstructured 3D triangular meshes. Mesh-lab is a very low-level\sidenote{Low-level programming involves direct manipulation of hardware resources, offering granular control but requiring detailed hardware knowledge.} program; it was used to try and remove the non-manifold edges; however, the methods to do so require knowledge of advanced mathematical equations and how to manipulate them. With initial attempts and references to online tutorials resulting in the model being distorted and unusable, the decision was made to find more user-friendly software.

% With concerted effort MeshLab might have been able to resolve the issues but with many options on the market it was thought that looking elsewhere would be more beneficial. 

AutoCAD NetFabb seemed a fitting replacement as mentioned in many online forums discussing MeshLab's limitations. Initially designed for additive manufacturing pre-processing, it also contained a diverse suite of valuable tools to repair the model. Personalised repair kits could be designed to fix specific issues for the \gls{TV} and, most importantly, had been developed for higher-level applications.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Repair Scripts
          \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering
              \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/NetFabbRepair.png}
              \caption{Netfabb Repair Scripts}
              \label{fig:NetfabbRepair}
          \end{figure}
    \item Shell
          \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering
              \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/NetFabbShell.png}
              \caption{Netfabb Shell Tool}
              \label{fig:NetfabbShell}
          \end{figure}
\end{itemize}


After the repairing and hollow shell process was complete, the model could trial some prototyping methods; the model was given a retainer ring to allow for easy mounting and printed with a FormLabs \gls{SLA} printer. From initial attempts at fabrication using the silicone moulding method, it was evident that casting the tendineae would not be feasible, so a tool within NetFabb was found to remove them from the geometry.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/nfcut}
    \caption{Netfabb Cutting Tool}
    \label{fig:Netfabbcut}
\end{figure}

From here, the model was imported into Blender to further refine it, as NetFabb was not capable of detailed mesh sculpting to refine the model by hand. In Blender, the main objective was to smooth out the bumps in the leaflets left from the cuts and ensure they were of a uniform thickness without straying too far from the original geometry.

Meshmixer was used in tandem with Blender as it contained a handy thickness analysis tool which could be used to see the varying thicknesses of the leaflets in the imported model. Blender was then used to manually edit the model using its sculpting tools to thicken or thin the surface where appropriate. This would have been much easier if a dynamic thickness overlay had been developed in Blender and attempts to do so were made. Still, as the coding for personalised tools in the open-source program wasn't well documented, it was abandoned for the former method.





Once the final valve model was finalised, the decision was made to flatten the saddle shape of the geometry to simplify the moulding and mounting processes; some surgical studies like \citeonly{mahmoodChangesMitralValve2010} showed that for mitral valves, it does have a structural disadvantage; however, this did not reduce the ability to coapt correctly.

\section{Prototyping}
\subsection{Mould Die Iterations}
\newthought{Preliminary Prototyping Methods}
The prototyping method went through a few key stages. Throughout the simplified valve modelling stage, the running methods were creating \gls{PLA} prints of the flat and billowed valve models and then using a silicone mould to capture its likeness. Through feasibility testing, it was found this method was not suitable as;
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/silicone mould}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/silicone mould open}
    \caption{Silicone Mould Design}
    \label{fig:silimould}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Silicone moulds were not firm enough in casting to maintain sub 1mm thicknesses and deformed under their own weight.
    \item The mould release agent was less effective on \gls{PU}-Silicone interfaces than expected.
    \item The moulds, even with appropriate vent holes and degassing, would still have large air bubbles and not fill out to the edges of the part.
\end{itemize}
As it seemed no amount of optimization of this method would improve results, further work was done to find a more suitable method.

\newthought{Press Moulding}
This new method involved designing blocks in SolidWorks as a separate body to the valve part and using the 'Combine' tool to subtract the valve part. This hollowed block could then be split in the middle to create a two-part mould.\\
The \gls{PU} resin could then be poured into the cavity part, and the lid part pressed on top with a C-clamp to create a tight seal.
\mynewline
This method was trialled on the simplest flat valve model to seek learnings for my complicated designs; some such learnings were;
\begin{itemize}
    \item To measure the volume of the 2-part casting fluid with precision scales instead of doing it by eye, having the mixture slightly off resulted in gross discolouring and an extremely sticky surface.
    \item To develop a new chordal attachment method as the trialled insertion buds were ineffective.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/flat mould}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/flat valve}
    \caption{Press Mould Design and cast part for Flat Valve}
    \label{fig:flat mould}
\end{figure}

\mynewline
As the modelling stages evolved in complexity, so did the prototyping; in trialling preliminary anatomical valves for press moulds, it was discovered that due to STL interaction issues with solid \gls{CAD} geometries, the valve could not be moulded directly, and so a mould die was designed and prototyped of the valve part mould die, making it a two-step process to work around this modelling issue.

A deep-cast epoxy was used to pour into these die to form the moulds for the valve; the key learnings from this process were;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thin, easily breakable walls for the mould die were imperative as the epoxy parts were difficult to remove; this had a downside of making the die single-use. This was hoped to be avoided with notches to pry the epoxy part out, but ultimately, it wasn't effective.
    \item A split mould was trialled as it was thought to make demoulding the casted part easier; however, this resulted in significant lines being apparent and didn't help significantly in demoulding, so it was abandoned.
    \item Embossing and debossing key slots in the die ensured the moulds could be aligned correctly.
    \item Sanding down the \gls{PLA} prints to a smooth finish, so, in combination with a mould release, grease greatly eased the demolding of the die.
    \item Initial drafts of the mould die joined the cusps of leaflets directly; however, it was found that extruding the cusps axially stopped excess material from curing past the cusp of the leaflet and also acted as a central large key slot for pressing the moulds into each other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Casting Material Considerations}\marginpar{
    \textbf{Technical specifications:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/xencast-px30-soft-flexible-polyurethane-rubber}{PX30}
        \item \href{https://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet.aspx?matguid=ecd48c5bb9e143c4a956f3b904196766&ckck=1}{PURPLAN}
    \end{itemize}
}
The two main options for material under consideration were \gls{PU} and silicone; with needing a low shore hardness and casting viscosity for the initial mould designs, a shore 30a \gls{PU} from Xencast was chosen as it had much lower viscosity than popular silicones of the same hardness. It also similar properties to the PURPLAN \gls{PU} used in \citeonly{luoEffectBendingRigidity2012} which yielded good results, efforts to get samples of PURPLAN were made but lead times and costs were prohibitive so the XencastPX30 was the closest alternative within budget.


Once successful \gls{PU} parts had been cast, the eco-flex 00-20 silicone was trialled to see if it performed similarly. Results were unsuccessful with the silicone parts, coming out not fully cured after extended curing times were tried, this might have been due to the low temperature in the lab however was not investigated further as \gls{PU} parts were successful.

\subsection{Chordae Tendineae}\label{sec:Chord}
Initial conceptualization of the chordae tendineae involved having the valve as one homogenous material with the tendineae attached within the mould. However, as the project progressed and the complexity of the valve increased, it was decided that the tendineae should be a separate part that could be attached after the valve was cast. This was decided on as the elastic modulus of the tendineae was vastly different as they function to be pulled taut to stop the leaflets from prolapsing.

\newthought{Design of Choice:}
A 0.1mm nylon fishing wire was chosen to represent the tendineae as it was thin enough to be completely collapsible and not interfere with the opening in the diastolic phase.
The attachment to the valve was the more challenging aspect, a few methods were considered and tested:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Testing the methods for attaching the chordae tendineae to leaflets}
    \label{fig:ctattachment}
    % \end{fullwidth}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suture patterns along the cusp of the leaflets.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item A short continuous suture was used to attach a few tendineae to the leaflets on a sample piece of \gls{PU} how on a gentle tensile test the suture ripped out as the \gls{PU} wasn't strong enough to hold.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Using a small hole in the leaflet to thread the tendineae through and then knotting it on the other side.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item This method also failed as the elasticity of the \gls{PU} made it so the knot would have to be \gls{PU} would rip anyway.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Embedding the wire in the \gls{PU} leaflets.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item While hopeful the embedding technique proved not feasible as the wire just slipped out, there was an attempt made with thick and thin layers of additional \gls{PU} but to no avail.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Gluing the tendineae to the leaflets with a cyanoacrylate adhesive.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item While this method showed initial promise as the adhesive was strong enough to hold the tendineae after seconds of curing when 24 hours passed, the adhesive would harden much stiffer and deform the leaflets, making them very rigid.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Gluing with B7000 adhesive.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The B7000 adhesive was chosen as it was a flexible adhesive, initial tests weren't fruitful but if left to set fully over 24 hours the bond became very strong and the leaflets retained their flexibility while also only needing a minuscule amount for a good hold so the very thin thickness of the leaflets wasnt negated.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fixturing}
\marginpar{
    \footnotesize
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/fixturesketch}
    \captionof{figure}{Initial Sketch of Fixturing}
}
The design criterion was considered carefully before modelling the test fixturing. The main desired outcomes from the testing that the fixturing should facilitate were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The chordae tendineae should have anchors which are fully adjustable axially and angularly to allow for a range of testing positions.
    \item The valve should be mounted in a way that the leaflets are not obstructed so the valve can be viewed from multiple angles for thorough evaluation.

\end{itemize}

\newthought{Design of Choice:}
A combination of 3D printed parts, off-the-shelf components and hand-cut threaded rods were used to emulate the initial sketch of the rig

The threaded rods allowed for the anchoring points of the tendineae to be adjusted axially.
Attached to the rods was the ring system with notches that could be adjusted angularly which the mock tendineae were passed through and fastened to with a rubber wedge.
