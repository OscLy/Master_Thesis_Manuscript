  abstract = {Heart valves play a very important role in the functioning of the heart and many of the heart failures are related to the valvular dysfunctions, e.g. aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. As the medical field is moving towards a patient-specific diagnosis and treatment procedures, modeling of heart valves with patient-specific information is becoming a significant tool in medical field. Here we present the ingredients for valve simulation specifically the aortic valve, with a main focus on a novel spline-based mapping technique which solves many issues in generating patient-specific models – the microstructural mapping, the pre-strain calculations, prescribing dynamic boundary conditions, validation and inverse-modeling to obtain material parameters.},

  abstract = {In the current regulatory climate, the Food and Drug Administration requires that all invasive cardiac devices are subjected to in vivo testing prior to human clinical trials and/or medical use. The most effective method for assessing the in vivo performance, durability, and biocompatibility of a novel heart valve therapy is through testing within the appropriate animal model. For replacement heart valves, preclinical testing is performed under strict regulatory guidelines to critically assess the performance of the device and the response of the host, by accurately replicating the intended human implantation procedure. This ensures the collection of relevant data and minimizes the potential for distress or discomfort to the test subject. The fundamental goals of a preclinical study are to report any detectable pathological consequences of the procedure, to report any macro- or microscopically detectable structural alterations in the device itself, and to histologically assess any thromboembolic material, inflammatory reactions, or degenerative processes. The success of a preclinical trial relies on careful protocol design, choosing the appropriate animal model, and adhering to the regulatory guidelines for Good Laboratory Practices. Importantly, the continued use of animal models in cardiac research has also benefited the field of veterinary science and, until in vitro and in silico methods provide suitable alternatives, will continue to be the most accurate assessment for the next generations of valve therapies.},

  abstract = {Multi-detector row CT has developed into a valuable tool for noninvasive imaging of the heart. The major indication of cardiac CT represents the diagnosis or exclusion of coronary artery disease. Owing to its cross-sectional nature, the same data obtained for the coronary arteries contain morpho-anatomical information about the cardiac chambers and valves. When scanning in the retrospectively electrocardiography-gated mode, data can be reconstructed in various phases of the cardiac cycle. This enables assessing the movement of the open and closed valves. When performing planimetric measurements of the valve opening and regurgitant orifice areas in case of stenotic and regurgitant valves, estimations of valvular function can be given that correlate well with the results from echocardiography. This article reviews the current evidence regarding the accuracy of CT for imaging the morphology and function of the cardiac valves.},

  abstract = {The treatment of patients with intravenous drug use (IVDU) has evolved to include a wide range of medications, psychiatric rehabilitation, and surgical interventions, especially for life-threatening complications such as infective endocarditis (IE). These interventions remain at the discretion of physicians, particularly surgeons, whose treatment decisions are influenced by several medical factors, unfortunately not without bias. The stigma associated with substance use disorder is prevalent, which leads to significant biases, even in the healthcare system. This bias is heightened when IVDU patients require repeat valve replacement surgeries for IE due to continued drug use. Patients who receive a valve replacement and continue to use illicit drugs intravenously often return to their medical providers, months to a few years later, with a reinfection of their bioprosthetic valve; such patients require additional surgeries which are at the center of many ethical discussions due to high mortality rates, for many complex medical and social reasons, associated with continuous chemical dependency after surgical interventions. This chapter examines the ethics of repeat heart valve replacement surgery for patients who are struggling with addiction. Considerations of justice, the fiduciary therapeutic relationship, and guiding ethical principles justify medically beneficial repeat heart valve replacement surgeries for IVDU patient populations.},

  abstract = {The heart is not only our most vital, but also our most complex organ: Precisely controlled by the interplay of electrical and mechanical fields, it consists of four chambers and four valves, which act in concert to regulate its filling, ejection, and overall pump function. While numerous computational models exist to study either the electrical or the mechanical response of its individual chambers, the integrative electro-mechanical response of the whole heart remains poorly understood. Here we present a proof-of-concept simulator for a four-chamber human heart model created from computer topography and magnetic resonance images. We illustrate the governing equations of excitation–contraction coupling and discretize them using a single, unified finite element environment. To illustrate the basic features of our model, we visualize the electrical potential and the mechanical deformation across the human heart throughout its cardiac cycle. To compare our simulation against common metrics of cardiac function, we extract the pressure–volume relationship and show that it agrees well with clinical observations. Our prototype model allows us to explore and understand the key features, physics, and technologies to create an integrative, predictive model of the living human heart. Ultimately, our simulator will open opportunities to probe landscapes of clinical parameters, and guide device design and treatment planning in cardiac diseases such as stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse of the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, or mitral valve.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS The advent of the polymeric synthetic heart valve will hopefully allow the limitations of other commonly used artificial heart valves to be overcome. Currently the valves adopted in practice include mechanical heart valves and biological heart valves. The mechanical valves are prone to thrombosis formation in the blood and require long-term anticoagulant therapy. The biological valves lose their tissue replacement function as a result of their chemical treatment which results in tissue fatigue damage in service. Polymeric synthetic heart valves that mimic the function of a real valve will hopefully overcome these difficulties. In this chapter, various elastomeric materials (polyurethane, silicone rubber and EPDM), that can be used to make polymeric synthetic heart valves, have been assessed by measuring their strain energy release rate for a wide range of crack growth rates. This was measured using static loading under a variety of conditions in order to evaluate their potential performance as target materials. Polyurethane is the most suitable matrix material of the three candidates from a consideration of the tear resistance. The behaviour of the polyurethane is similar to that of a strain crystallising material and as a result it would appear that some comparable form of reinforcement takes place. At the temperatures encountered in the body there is a significant decrease in the tearing energy for a given crack growth rate due to a reduction in the viscoelasticity. Despite this, it would still appear that polyurethane is the most suitable material for use in a synthetic heart valve.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective: This work describes the experimental validation of a cardiac simulator for three heart rates (60, 80 and 100 beats per minute), under physiological conditions, as a suitable environment for prosthetic heart valves testing in the mitral or aortic position. Methods: In the experiment, an aortic bileaflet mechanical valve and a mitral bioprosthesis were employed in the left ventricular model. A test fluid of 47.6\% by volume of glycerin solution in water at 36.5ºC was used as blood analogue fluid. A supervisory control and data acquisition system implemented previously in LabVIEW was applied to induce the ventricular operation and to acquire the ventricular signals. The parameters of the left ventricular model operation were based on in vivo and in vitro data. The waves of ventricular and systemic pressures, aortic flow, stroke volume, among others, were acquired while manual adjustments in the arterial impedance model were also established. Results: The acquired waves showed good results concerning some in vivo data and requirements from the ISO 5840 standard. Conclusion: The experimental validation was performed, allowing, in future studies, characterizing the hydrodynamic performance of prosthetic heart valves.},

  abstract = {The aorta with its compliance plays a major role in hemodynamics as it saves a portion of ejected blood during systole which is then released in diastole. The aortic compliance decreases with increasing age, which is related to several cardiovascular imparities and diseases. Changes in flow patterns and pressure curves, due to varying aortic compliance, are difficult to investigate in vivo. As a result, the aim of the present work was to develop an in vitro setup enabling standardized investigations on the effect of compliance changes on flow patterns and pressure curves. Therefore an experimental setup with an anatomically correct silicone phantom of the aortic arch was developed, suitable for optical flow measurements under pulsatile inflow conditions. The setup was developed for precise adjustments of different compliances and optical flow measurements. Particle image velocimetry measurements were carried out downstream of the aortic valve in the center plane perpendicular to the valve with compliance adjusted between 0.62~×~10−3 to 1.82~×~10−3~mmHg−1. Preliminary results of the in vitro investigations showed that decreases in compliance results in significant increases in pressure changes with respect to time (dp/dt) and altered pressure curves in the aortic arch. In terms of flow, an increased aortic stiffness lead to higher mean velocities and decreased vortex development in the aortic sinuses. As in vivo validation and translation remains difficult, the results have to be considered as preliminary in vitro insights into the mechanisms of (age-related) compliance changes.},

However, translation of these technologies into clinical applications, such as planning of medical procedures, has been limited to a few single case reports. Hence, the use of patient-specific models is still far from becoming a standard of care in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe our experience with a modelling framework that allows patient-specific simulations to be used for prediction of clinical outcomes. A cohort of 12 patients with congenital heart disease who were referred for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, stenting of aortic coarctation and surgical repair of double-outlet right ventricle was included in this study. Image data routinely acquired for clinical assessment were post-processed to set up patient-specific models and test device implantation and surgery. Finite-element and computational fluid dynamics analyses were run to assess feasibility of each intervention and provide some guidance. Results showed good agreement between simulations and clinical decision including feasibility, device choice and fluid-dynamic parameters. The promising results of this pilot study support translation of computer simulations as tools for personalization of cardiovascular treatments.},

Neurohormonal systems, which are normally stimulated under conditions of acute volume depletion, are activated by the low cardiac output and arterial pressure. However, sustained and chronic activation of these systems, as occurs in congestive heart failure (CHF), can cause progressive ventricular remodeling and worsening heart failure. Vasoconstriction, water retention, and increased blood volume are results of the activation of the SNS, the renin-angiotensin pathway, and AVP secretion. These effects can accelerate progression of CHF, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. AVP regulates vascular tone and free-water reabsorption, respectively, through the vasopressin V1a and V2 receptor subtypes and therefore is a potential neurohormonal target in the treatment of CHF.},

Materials and Methods Patients who received a 10-F dual-lumen silicone catheter or 9.5-F dual-lumen polyurethane catheter between January 2002 and July 2009 were identified through a quality assurance database. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 117 silicone and 94 polyurethane catheters were identified in 192 patients. Reasons for catheter placement and removal were recorded, as were cases of breakage and repairs. Catheter durability was compared; survival analysis was also performed. Results Breakage occurred in nine of 117 silicone catheters (8\%) and none of 94 polyurethane catheters (P = .005). Most catheters were placed for malignancy (162 of 211; 77\%); nonmalignant indications such as total parenteral nutrition accounted for 49 out of 211 catheters (23\%). The mean silicone catheter dwell time was 99 days (11,612 total catheter-days), and the mean polyurethane catheter dwell time was 78 days (7,362 total catheter-days). There was no significant difference in overall duration of function (ie, survival) between silicone and polyurethane catheters (P = .12). The infection rates were 3.6 per 1,000 catheter-days for silicone catheters and 3.5 per 1,000 catheter-days for polyurethane catheters (P value not significant). Conclusions There were fewer catheter fractures with the polyurethane catheter compared with the silicone catheter, although there was no difference in the total access site service interval for the two catheter types.},

  abstract = {Significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding, affecting about one in twenty-five subjects among the elderly and presenting more frequently in women than in men. This review summarizes data concerning etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology and management strategies of TR. The tricuspid valve (TV) has a broad anatomical variability. Classically, TR has been distinguished as primary and secondary or functional TR (FTR), with the latter being the most prevalent. FTR is a multifactorial disorder, resulting from maladaptive right ventricular remodeling secondary to pulmonary hypertension or from atrial fibrillation leading to dilation of the right atrium, tricuspid annulus and base of the right ventricle, with pathological TV coaptation. Thus two main types of FTR can be identified: pulmonary hypertension-FTR and idiopathic-FTR, depending on which factor, ventricular or atrial respectively, is the primum movens of the disease. Appreciable evidence suggests that significant TR leads to worsening prognosis regardless of the underlying etiology and should be addressed as a separate therapeutic target. The treatment of TR in patients undergoing left-sided cardiac surgery is well established. Isolated surgical repair of TR is instead rarely performed because patients are often deemed inoperable due to prohibitive risk. Besides, perioperative mortality remains higher than for any other valve. Several transcatheter TV replacement and repair systems, the latter mostly borrowed from percutaneous treatment systems of mitral regurgitation or from TV repair surgical techniques, have shown efficacy and safety when used on the TV. These could provide an effective treatment option for patients not eligible for surgery.},

  abstract = {Valvular heart disease is currently treated with mechanical valves, which benefit from longevity, but are burdened by chronic anticoagulation therapy, or with bioprosthetic valves, which have reduced thromboembolic risk, but limited durability. Tissue engineered heart valves have been proposed to resolve these issues by implanting a scaffold that is replaced by endogenous growth, leaving autologous, functional leaflets that would putatively eliminate the need for anticoagulation and avoid calcification. Despite the diversity in fabrication strategies and encouraging results in large animal models, control over engineered valve structure-function remains at best partial. This study aimed to overcome these limitations by introducing double component deposition (DCD), an electrodeposition technique that employs multi-phase electrodes to dictate valve macro and microstructure and resultant function. Results in this report demonstrate the capacity of the DCD method to simultaneously control scaffold macro-scale morphology, mechanics and microstructure while producing fully assembled stent-less multi-leaflet valves composed of microscopic fibers. DCD engineered valve characterization included: leaflet thickness, biaxial properties, bending properties, and quantitative structural analysis of multi-photon and scanning electron micrographs. Quasi-static ex-vivo valve coaptation testing and dynamic organ level functional assessment in a pressure pulse duplicating device demonstrated appropriate acute valve functionality.},

  abstract = {Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures have been used for replacement of chordae tendineae since 1985. They have been used for correction of prolapse of mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets as well as for resuspension of the papillary muscles during mitral valve replacement when the native chordae cannot be preserved to maintain continuity between the mitral annulus and papillary muscles. The sutures used were 5CV Gore-Tex for replacement of the chordae tendineae of the anterior leaflet and 6CV for the posterior leaflet and commissural areas of the mitral valve. Initially one suture was used to create two artificial chordae, but as experience increased, the technique was modified and multiple pairs of artificial chordae were created with a single suture by passing successively through the fibrous portions of the a papillary muscle and the free margin of the prolapsing segment of leaflet, and tying the tends together on the papillary muscle head. This technique creates artificial chordae that are interdependent and their lengths are self-adjusting when pressure is exerted on the leaflets. From 1985 to 1998, 288 patients had artificial chordae used during mitral valve repair for degenerative disease of the mitral valve. Prolapse of both leaflets was present in 51\% of patients, isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet in 28\%, and posterior leaflet in 21\%. The mean follow-up was 4.8 ± 3.0 years and was complete. At 10 years, the freedom from mitral regurgitation {$>$}2+ was 88 ± 6\% and the freedom from reoperation was 92 ± 2\%. Failures of repair were unrelated to the artificial chordae. Gore-Tex sutures are an excellent material to replace chordae tendineae, appear to be free of adverse effects, and have become a valuable adjunct to the surgical armamentarium to treat mitral and tricuspid valve disease.},

  abstract = {Purpose Only mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses are currently commercially available. The former show longer durability but require anticoagulant therapy; the latter display better fluid dynamic behavior but do not have adequate durability. New Polymeric Heart Valves (PHVs) could potentially combine the hemodynamic properties of biological valves with the durability of mechanical valves. This work presents a hydrodynamic evaluation of 2 groups of newly developed supra-annular, trileaflet prosthetic heart valves made from styrenic block copolymers (SBC): Poli-Valves. Methods 2 types of Poli-Valves made of SBC and differing in polystyrene fraction content were tested under continuous and pulsatile flow conditions as prescribed by ISO 5840 Standard. A pulse duplicator designed ad hoc allowed the valve prototypes to be tested at different flow rates and frequencies. Pressure and flow were recorded; pressure drops, effective orifice area (EOA), and regurgitant volume were computed to assess the behavior of the valve. Results Both types of Poli-Valves met the minimum requirements in terms of regurgitation and EOA as specified by the ISO 5840 Standard. Results were compared with 5 mechanical heart valves (MHVs) and 5 tissue heart valves (THVs), currently available on the market. Conclusions Based on these results, PHVs based on styrenic block copolymers, as are Poli-Valves, can be considered a promising alternative for heart valve replacement in the near future.},

Mechanical prostheses, based on carbon, metallic and polymeric components, require permanent anticoagulation treatment, and their usage often leads to adverse reactions, e.g. thromboembolic complications and endocarditis. Xenogenous and allogenous biological prostheses are associated with immune reaction, thrombosis and degeneration, and thus they have a high rate of reoperation. Biological prostheses of autologous origin, such as pulmonary autografts, often burden the patient with a complicated surgery and the risk of reoperation. Therefore, efforts are being made to prepare bioartificial heart valves with an autologous biological component by methods of tissue engineering. They should be biocompatible, durable, endowed with appropriate mechanical properties and able to grow with a child. For this purpose, scaffolds composed of synthetic materials, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(caprolactone), poly(4-hydroxybutyrate), hydrogels or natural polymers, e.g. collagen, elastin, fibrin or hyaluronic acid, have been seeded with autologous differentiated, progenitor or stem cells. Promising results have been obtained with nanostructured scaffolds, and also with cultivation in special dynamic bioreactors prior to implantation of the bioartificial grafts into an animal organism.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary and/or tricuspid valve dysfunction is common among individuals with congenital heart disease, and surgical intervention often carries prohibitive risks. Transcatheter valve replacement (TVR) of the right-sided cardiac valves has become a viable treatment option over the past two decades, while continued technological development aims to broaden its applicability to an even larger portion of those with repaired congenital heart disease. To date, two transcatheter valves have been approved for use in patients with dysfunctional right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduits as well as those with failing pulmonic bioprosthetic valves, and are also used off-label in the “native” RVOT and within surgically repaired/replaced but failing tricuspid valves. TVR has demonstrated comparable safety and short-term outcomes to that of surgical valve replacement. This article aims to review current available devices, focusing on their safety, efficacy and on and off label usage, while briefly describing some of the emerging devices and novel procedural techniques that will likely lead to significant expansion of transcatheter treatment of right sided valve disease in the future.},

  abstract = {Calcification currently represents a major cause of failure of biological tissue heart valves. It is a complex phenomenon influenced by a number of biochemical and mechanical factors. Recent advances in material science offer new polymers with improved properties, potentially suitable for synthetic leaflets heart valves manufacturing. In this study, the calcification-resistance efficacy and mechanical and surface properties of a new nanocomposite polymeric material (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane–poly(carbonate-urea)urethane; POSS–PCU) which has been developed by our group are assessed by means of in vitro testing. In particular, thin sheets of nanocomposite, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (BP) and polyurethane (PU) were exposed to a calcium solution into a specially designed in vitro accelerated physiological pulsatile pressure system for a period of 31days and a total of 4×107 cycles. The samples were investigated for signs of calcification after exposure to calcium solution by means of X-ray, microscopic and chemical inspections. Mechanical and surface properties were also studied using stress–strain behaviour and surface morphology and hydrophobicity. Comparison shows that, in the experimental conditions, the level of calcification for the nanocomposite is considerably lower than for the fixed BP (p=0.008) and PU samples (p=0.015). Also, mechanical properties were unchanged in POSS–PCU, while there was a significant deterioration in PU samples (p{$<$}0.05). Hydrophobicity was significantly reduced in both the POSS–PCU and PU samples (p{$<$}0.0001). However, the POSS–PCU nanocomposite remained more hydrophobic than the PU sample (p{$<$}0.0001). Less platelet adhered to the POSS–PCU compared to the PU (p{$<$}0.0001). These results indicate that the use of this nanocomposite in synthetic leaflets heart valves may lead to potential advantages in terms of long-term performances and durability.},

Valvular heart diseases often involve multiple dysfunctions and require joint assessment and therapy of the valves. In this paper, we propose a complete and modular patient-specific model of the cardiac valvular apparatus estimated from 4D cardiac CT data. A new constrained Multi-linear Shape Model (cMSM), conditioned by anatomical measurements, is introduced to represent the complex spatio-temporal variation of the heart valves. The cMSM is exploited within a learning-based framework to efficiently estimate the patient-specific valve parameters from cine images. Experiments on 64 4D cardiac CT studies demonstrate the performance and clinical potential of the proposed method. Our method enambles automatic quantitative evaluation of the complete valvular apparatus based on non-invasive imaging techniques. In conjunction with existent patient-specific chamber models, the presented valvular model enables personalized computation modeling and realistic simulation of the entire cardiac system.},

In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effect of fundamental curves on the geometric orifice area and the coaptation area by implementing a two-level Taguchi Orthogonal Array (OA) design (Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique) and the interaction plots to investigate the individual contributions. The leaflet geometry was represented with the attachment curve, the free edge, and the belly curve. A total of three varying control coordinates were used to form different leaflet surfaces. With two different biocompatible polymers, 16 finite element models were prepared. Each model was subjected to time-varying transvalvular pressure. The results showed that the control coordinate for the belly curve has the highest impact on the coaptation area of the valve models with higher average 100\% modulus. The geometric orifice area was affected by both control points of the attachment curve and the belly curve. A similar effect was also observed for the valve models with lower average 100\% modulus.},

  abstract = {As decisions in cardiology increasingly rely on noninvasive methods, fast and precise image processing tools have become a crucial component of the analysis workflow. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first automatic system for patient-specific modeling and quantification of the left heart valves, which operates on cardiac computed tomography (CT) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) data. Robust algorithms, based on recent advances in discriminative learning, are used to estimate patient-specific parameters from sequences of volumes covering an entire cardiac cycle. A novel physiological model of the aortic and mitral valves is introduced, which captures complex morphologic, dynamic, and pathologic variations. This holistic representation is hierarchically defined on three abstraction levels: global location and rigid motion model, nonrigid landmark motion model, and comprehensive aortic-mitral model. First we compute the rough location and cardiac motion applying marginal space learning. The rapid and complex motion of the valves, represented by anatomical landmarks, is estimated using a novel trajectory spectrum learning algorithm. The obtained landmark model guides the fitting of the full physiological valve model, which is locally refined through learned boundary detectors. Measurements efficiently computed from the aortic-mitral representation support an effective morphological and functional clinical evaluation. Extensive experiments on a heterogeneous data set, cumulated to 1516 TEE volumes from 65 4-D TEE sequences and 690 cardiac CT volumes from 69 4-D CT sequences, demonstrated a speed of 4.8 seconds per volume and average accuracy of 1.45 mm with respect to expert defined ground-truth. Additional clinical validations prove the quantification precision to be in the range of inter-user variability. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a patient-specific model of the aortic and mitral valves is automatically estimated from volumetric sequences.},

  abstract = {Purpose Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) are complex procedures used to treat mitral valve (MV) pathologies, but with limited training opportunities available. To enable training, a realistic hemodynamic environment is needed. In this work we aimed to develop and validate a simulator that enables investigation of MV pathologies and their repair by MIMVS and TEER in a hemodynamic setting. Methods Different MVs were installed in the simulator, and pressure, flow, and transesophageal echocardiographic measurements were obtained. To confirm the simulator’s physiological range, we first installed a biological prosthetic, a mechanical prosthetic, and a competent excised porcine MV. Subsequently, we inserted two porcine MVs—one with induced chordae tendineae rupture and the other with a dilated annulus, along with a patient-specific silicone valve extracted from echocardiography with bi-leaflet prolapse. Finally, TEER and MIMVS procedures were conducted by experts to repair the MVs. Results Systolic pressures, cardiac outputs, and regurgitations volumes (RVol) with competent MVs were 119\,±\,1 mmHg, 4.78\,±\,0.16 l min−1, and 5\,±\,3 ml respectively, and thus within the physiological range. In contrast, the pathological MVs displayed increased RVols. MIMVS and TEER resulted in a decrease in RVols and mitigated the severity of mitral regurgitation. Conclusion Ex-vivo modelling of MV pathologies and repair procedures using the described simulator realistically replicated physiological in-vivo conditions. Furthermore, we showed the feasibility of performing MIMVS and TEER at the simulator, also at patient-specific level, thus providing new clinical perspectives in terms of training modalities and personalized planning.},

  abstract = {Valve replacement is the most common surgical treatment in patients with advanced valvular heart disease. Mechanical and bio-prostheses have been the traditional heart valve replacements in these patients. However, currently the heart valves for replacement therapy are imperfect and subject patients to one or more ongoing risks, including thrombosis, limited durability, and need for re-operations due to the lack of growth in pediatric populations. Furthermore, they require an open heart surgery, which is risky for elderly and young children who are too weak or ill to undergo major surgery. This article reviews the current state of the art of heart valve replacements in light of their potential clinical applications. In recent years polymeric materials have been widely studied as potential prosthetic heart valve material being designed to overcome the clinical problems associated with both mechanical and bio-prosthetic valves. The review also addresses the advances in polymer materials, tissue engineering approaches, and the development of percutaneous valve replacement technology and discusses the future prospects in these fields. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Abstract: This study investigates the transient regurgitant flow downstream of a prosthetic heart valve using both laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Until now, LDV has been the more commonly used tool in investigating the flow characteristics associated with mechanical heart valves. The LDV technique allows point-by-point velocity measurements and provides enough information about the temporal variations in the flow. The main drawback of this technique is the time consuming nature of the data acquisition process in order to assess an entire flow field area. The PIV technique, on the other hand, allows measurement of the entire flow field in space in a plane at a given instant. In this study, PIV with spatial resolution of 0 (1 mm) and LDV with a temporal resolution of 0 (1 ms) were used to measure the regurgitant flow proximal to the Björk-Shiley monostrut (BSM) valve in the mitral position. With PIV, the ability to measure 2 velocity components over an entire plane simultaneously provides a very different insight into the flow field compared to a more traditional point-to-point technique like LDV. In this study, a picture of the effects of occluder motion on the fluid flow in the atrial chamber is interpreted using an integration of PIV and LDV measurements. Specifically, fluid velocities in excess of 3.0 m/s were recorded in the pressure-driven jet during valve closure, and a 1.5 m/s sustained regurgitant jet was observed on the minor orifice side. Additionally, the effects of the impact and subsequent rebound of the occluder on the flow also were clearly recorded in spatial and temporal detail by the PIV and LDV measurements, respectively. The PIV results provide a visually intuitive way of interpreting the flow while the LDV data explore the temporal variations and trends in detail. This analysis is an integrated flow description of the effects of valve closure and leakage on the pulsatile regurgitation flow field past a tilting-disc mechanical heart valve (MHV). It further reinforces the hypothesis that the planar flow visualization techniques, when integrated with traditional point-to point techniques, provide significantly more insight into the complex pulsatile flow past MHVs.},

  abstract = {The facilitation of proper blood flow through the heart depends on proper function of heart valve components, and alterations to any component can lead to heart disease or failure. Comprehension of these valvular diseases is reliant on thorough characterization of healthy heart valve structures for use in computational models. Previously, computational models have treated these leaflet structures as a structurally and mechanically homogenous material, which may not be an accurate description of leaflet mechanical response. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mechanics of the heart valve leaflet as a structurally heterogenous material. Specifically, porcine mitral valve and tricuspid valve anterior leaflets were sectioned into six regions and biaxial mechanical tests with various loading ratios and stress-relaxation test were performed on each regional tissue sample. Three main findings from this study were summarized as follows: (i) the central regions of the leaflet had a more anisotropic nature than edge regions, (ii) the mitral valve anterior leaflet was more extensible in regions closer to the annulus, and (iii) there was variance in the stress-relaxation behavior among all six regions, with mitral valve leaflet tissue regions exhibiting a greater decay than the tricuspid valve regions. This study presents a novel investigation of the regional variations in the heart valve biomechanics that has not been comprehensively examined. Our results thus allow for a refinement of computational models for more accurately predicting diseased or surgically-intervened condition, where tissue heterogeneity plays an essential role in the heart valve function.},

These computational models are based on a hyperelastic finite element extension of the immersed boundary method for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). We focus on porcine tissue and bovine pericardial BHVs, which are commonly used in surgical valve replacement. We compare our numerical simulations to experimental data from two similar pulse duplicators, including a commercial ViVitro system and a custom platform related to the ViVitro pulse duplicator. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the computational and experimental results for bulk flow rates, pressures, valve open areas, and the timing of valve opening and closure in conditions commonly used to assess BHV performance. In addition, reasonable agreement is demonstrated for quantitative measures of leaflet kinematics under these same conditions. This work represents a step towards the experimental validation of this FSI modeling platform for evaluating BHVs.},

  abstract = {Proper tricuspid valve (TV) function is essential to unidirectional blood flow through the right side of the heart. Alterations to the tricuspid valvular components, such as the TV annulus, may lead to functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR), where the valve is unable to prevent undesired backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole. Various treatment options are currently available for FTR; however, research for the tricuspid heart valve, functional tricuspid regurgitation, and the relevant treatment methodologies are limited due to the pervasive expectation among cardiac surgeons and cardiologists that FTR will naturally regress after repair of left-sided heart valve lesions. Recent studies have focused on (i) understanding the function of the TV and the initiation or progression of FTR using both in-vivo and in-vitro methods, (ii) quantifying the biomechanical properties of the tricuspid valve apparatus as well as its surrounding heart tissue, and (iii) performing computational modeling of the TV to provide new insight into its biomechanical and physiological function. This review paper focuses on these advances and summarizes recent research relevant to the TV within the scope of FTR. Moreover, this review also provides future perspectives and extensions critical to enhancing the current understanding of the functioning and remodeling tricuspid valve in both the healthy and pathophysiological states.},

In vitro tests are intrinsically more effective when all the anatomical substructures of the valvular complexes are preserved. In this work, a mock apparatus able to house an entire explanted porcine heart and subject it to pulsatile fluid-dynamic conditions was developed, in order to enable the hemodynamic analysis of simulated surgical procedures and the imaging of the valvular structures. The mock loop's hydrodynamic design was based on an ad-hoc defined lumped-parameter model. The left ventricle of an entire swine heart was dynamically pressurized by an external computer-controlled pulse duplicator. The ascending aorta was connected to a hydraulic circuit which simulated the input impedance of the systemic circulation; a reservoir passively filled the left atrium. Accesses for endoscopic imaging were located in the apex of the left ventricle and in the aortic root. The experimental pressure and flow tracings were comparable with the typical in vivo curves; a mean flow of 3.5±0.1lpm and a mean arterial pressure of 101±2mmHg was obtained. High-quality echographic and endoscopic video recordings demonstrated the system's excellent potential in the observation of the cardiac structures dynamics. The proposed mock loop represents a suitable in vitro system for the testing of minimally-invasive cardiovascular devices and surgical procedures for heart valve repair.},

  abstract = {It has been reported previously that the mechanical properties of mitral valve chordae tendineae vary with chordal size and type. The popularity of mitral valve repair and chordal transposition warrant a better understanding of this phenomenon. The objectives of this study were to characterize the size- and type-related variations in chordal mechanics and explain them from the ultra-structural viewpoint. A total of 52 porcine mitral valve chordae from eight hearts were mechanically tested. We found that thicker chordae were more extensible than thinner chordae (4.2±1.5\%, 8.1±2.5\%, 15.7±3.9\% and 18.4±2.8\% strain corresponding to chordae with cross-sectional areas of 0.1−0.5, 0.5–1.0, 1.0–2.0, and 2.0–3.0mm2, respectively), and had lower moduli (90.1±22.3, 83.7±18.5, 66.3±13.5 and 61.7±13.3MPa corresponding to the same chordae groups). Polarized light microscopy was used to measure collagen fibril crimp. Thicker chordae had smaller crimp period than thinner chordae (11.3±1.4μm vs. 14.8±3.0μm), and were thus more highly crimped. Thicker chordae could therefore extend to greater strain before lock-up. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to measure choral fibril ultra-structure. Thinner chordae had lower average fibril diameter than thicker chordae but greater average fibril density. The cross-sectional area occupied by fibrils, however, was found to be constant at 49±2\% regardless of chordal size or type. The difference in moduli between thick and thin chordae can therefore be explained by differences in fibril packaging and hence fibril-to-fibril interactions. According to a simple fibril interaction model, chordae with smaller diameter fibrils will have a greater number of fibril-to-fibril interactions, and hence a greater modulus.},

  abstract = {Using different raw material in injection molding could happen in situations where the original material becomes unavailable, material cost rises, or in response to customer demands. However, applying different materials on the same mold often leads to excessive dimensional deviation, causing quality degradation. To reduce defect rate and circumvent high cost expenditure on new molds, this paper presents an experimental framework aiming to implement process optimization efficiently and attain a predictable level for the quality characteristics. The methodology starts from a Taguchi experimental design where process parameters including both controllable factors and uncontrollable factors were arranged into an orthogonal array. Driven by its efficiency, Taguchi method was able to produce optimal process parameter levels that significantly improved the process capability. Subsequently, data collected by an in-mold sensing system was analyzed to extract the contribution from in-mold process variables that are not externally accessible. In order to quantitatively rank the impacts from in-mold process variables, a multiple linear regression (MLR) were performed with top influential factors identified. The selected influential variables allowed for the quality characteristic to be predicted through a fuzzy logic based predictive model. In conclusion, the methodology presented in this paper has the potential of reducing or eliminating defect rate caused by material variation, and at the same time allows dimension prediction of injection molded parts with real time sensed in-mold conditions.},

Each of the chordae is attached at one end to the valve annulus and at the other to one of two chordal attachment points. These attachment points correspond to the positions where the chords of the real prosthesis would attach to the left-ventricular wall, although in the present study, these attachment points are kept fixed in space to facilitate comparison between our simulations and earlier results obtained from an experimental test rig. In our simulations, a time-dependent pressure difference derived from experimental measurements drives flow through the model valve during diastole and provides a realistic pressure load during systole. In previous modelling studies of this valve prosthesis, the valve presents an unrealistically large orifice at beginning of diastole and does not close completely at the end of diastole. We show that including a description of the chordal bending stiffness enables the model valve to close properly at the end of the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Valve over-opening is eliminated only by incorporating a description of the bending stiffnesses of the valve leaflets into the model. Thus, bending stiffness plays a significant role in the dynamic behaviour of the polyurethane mitral valve prosthesis.},

  abstract = {Background Saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings are being increasingly used during mitral valve (MV) repair to conform the mitral annulus to a more nonplanar shape and possibly reduce leaflet stress. In this study utilizing three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography we compared the effects of rigid flat rings with those of the saddle rings on the mitral annular geometry. Specifically we measured the changes in nonplanarity angle (NPA) before and after MV repair. Methods Geometric analysis on 38 patients undergoing MV repair for myxomatous and ischemic mitral regurgitation with full flat rings (n = 18) and saddle rings (n = 18) were performed. The acquired three-dimensional volumetric data were analyzed utilizing the “Image Arena” software (TomTec GmBH, Munich, Germany). Specifically, the degree of change in the NPA was calculated and compared before and after repair for both types of rings. Results Both types of annuloplasty rings resulted in significant changes in the geometric structure of the MV after repair. However, saddle rings lead to a decrease in the NPA (7\% for ischemic and 8\% for myxomatous MV repairs) (ie, made the annulus more nonplanar), whereas flat rings increased the NPA (7.9\% for ischemic and 11.8\% for myxomatous MV repairs) (ie, made the annulus less nonplanar); p value 0.001 or less. Conclusions Implantation of saddle-shaped rings during MV repair surgery is associated with augmentation of the nonplanar shape of the mitral annulus (ie, decreases NPA). This favorable change in the mitral annular geometry could possibly confer a structural advantage to MV repairs with the saddle rings.},

  abstract = {Nearly 1.6 million Americans suffer from a leaking tricuspid heart valve. To make matters worse, current valve repair options are far from optimal leading to recurrence of leakage in up to 30\% of patients. We submit that a critical step toward improving outcomes is to better understand the “forgotten” valve. High-fidelity computer models may help in this endeavour. However, the existing models are limited by averaged or idealized geometries, material properties, and boundary conditions. In our current work, we overcome the limitations of existing models by (reverse) engineering the tricuspid valve from a beating human heart in an organ preservation system. The resulting finite-element model faithfully captures the kinematics and kinetics of the native tricuspid valve as validated against echocardiographic data and others’ previous work. To showcase the value of our model, we also use it to simulate disease-induced and repair-induced changes to valve geometry and mechanics. Specifically, we simulate and compare the effectiveness of tricuspid valve repair via surgical annuloplasty and via transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Importantly, our model is openly available for others to use. Thus, our model will allow us and others to perform virtual experiments on the healthy, diseased, and repaired tricuspid valve to better understand the valve itself and to optimize tricuspid valve repair for better patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Although heart valve replacement is among the most common cardiovascular surgical procedures, their outcome is often difficult to predict. One of the reasons is the design and choice of the materials used for the fabrication of the prostheses. This review paper describes the use of modeling techniques in prosthetic heart valve (HV) design and aims at the justification and development of a polymer based trileaflet mechanical heart valve (MHV). The closing/opening phase behavior of the bileaflet MHV was investigated. The potential problem of valve failure due to crack propagation in the brittle pyrolytic carbon leaflet was also discussed. These studies suggest that although bileaflet MHV performs satisfactorily, there are justifications for improvement. Since the native aortic HV is trileaflet and made of anisotropic and hyperelastic tissue, one possible approach to a better MHV design is based on our ability to closely mimic the natural geometry and biomaterial properties.},

Coordinates representing the annulus and the leaflets were imported into MeshLab (Visual Computing Lab ISTICNR) to develop solid models to be converted to stereolithographic file format and 3D print. Measurements of the TV annulus antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) diameters, perimeter (P), and TV tenting height (H) and volume (V) obtained from the 3D echo data set were compared with those performed on the 3D models using a caliper, a syringe and a millimeter tape. Antero-posterior (4.2\,±\,0.2\,cm vs. 4.2\,±\,0\,cm), ML (3.7\,±\,0.2\,cm vs. 3.6\,±\,0.1\,cm), P (12.6\,±\,0.2\,cm vs. 12.7\,±\,0.1\,cm), H (11.2\,±\,2.1\,mm vs. 10.8\,±\,2.1\,mm) and V (3.0\,±\,0.6\,ml vs. 2.8\,±\,1.4\,ml) were similar (P\,=\,NS for all) when measured on the 3D data set and the printed model. The two sets of measurements were highly correlated (r\,=\,0.991). The mean absolute error (2D\,−\,3D) for AP, ML, P and tenting H was 0.7\,±\,0.3\,mm, indicating accuracy of the 3D model of\,\&lt;1\,mm.Three-dimensional printing of the TV from 3DTTE data is feasible with highly conserved fidelity. This technique has the potential for rapid integration into clinical practice to assist with decision-making, surgical planning, and teaching.},

  abstract = {Background:  In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with circulatory failure and death. We hypothesized that the tricuspid valve (TV) structure of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with a Fontan circulation and moderate or greater TR differs from those with mild or less TR, and that right ventricle volume is associated with TV structure and dysfunction. Methods: TV of 100 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and a Fontan circulation were modeled using transthoracic 3-dimensional echocardiograms and custom software in SlicerHeart. Associations of TV structure to TR grade and right ventricle function and volume were investigated. Shape parameterization and analysis was used to calculate the mean shape of the TV leaflets, their principal modes of variation, and to characterize associations of TV leaflet shape to TR. Results: In univariate modeling, patients with moderate or greater TR had larger TV annular diameters and area, greater annular distance between the anteroseptal commissure and anteroposterior commissure, greater leaflet billow volume, and more laterally directed anterior papillary muscle angles compared to valves with mild or less TR (all P{$<$}0.001). In multivariate modeling greater total billow volume, lower anterior papillary muscle angle, and greater distance between the anteroposterior commissure and anteroseptal commissure were associated with moderate or greater TR (P{$<$}0.001, C statistic=0.85). Larger right ventricle volumes were associated with moderate or greater TR (P{$<$}0.001). TV shape analysis revealed structural features associated with TR, but also highly heterogeneous TV leaflet structure. Conclusions: Moderate or greater TR in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with a Fontan circulation is associated with greater leaflet billow volume, a more laterally directed anterior papillary muscle angle, and greater annular distance between the anteroseptal commissure and anteroposterior commissure. However, there is significant heterogeneity of structure in the TV leaflets in regurgitant valves. Given this variability, an image-informed patient-specific approach to surgical planning may be needed to achieve optimal outcomes in this vulnerable and challenging population.},

  abstract = {Intra-ventricular flow dynamics has recently emerged as an important evaluation and diagnosis tool in different cardiovascular conditions. The formation of vortex pattern during the cardiac cycle has been suggested to play important epigenetic and energy-modulation roles in cardiac remodelling, adaptations and mal-adaptations. In this new perspective, flow alterations due to different cardiovascular procedures can affect the long-term outcome of those procedures. Especially, repairs and replacements performed on atrioventricular valves are likely to exert direct impact on intra-ventricular flow pattern. In this review, current consensus around the roles of vortex dynamics in cardiac function is discussed. An overview of physiological vortex patterns found in healthy left and right ventricles as well as post-operative ventricular flow phenomenon owing to different atrioventricular valvular procedures are reviewed, followed by the summary of different vortex identification schemes used to characterise intraventricular flow. This paper also emphasises on future research directions towards a comprehensive understanding of intra-cardiac flow and its clinical relevance. The knowledge could encourage more effective pre-operative planning and better outcomes for current clinical practices.},

  abstract = {Background Valvular heart diseases are not usually regarded as a major public-health problem. Our aim was to assess their prevalence and effect on overall survival in the general population. Methods We pooled population-based studies to obtain data for 11\hphantom{,}911 randomly selected adults from the general population who had been assessed prospectively with echocardiography. We also analysed data from a community study of 16\hphantom{,}501 adults who had been assessed by clinically indicated echocardiography. Findings In the general population group, moderate or severe valve disease was identified in 615 adults. There was no difference in the frequency of such diseases between men and women (p=0·90). Prevalence increased with age, from 0·7\% (95\% CI 0·5–1·0) in 18–44 year olds to 13·3\% (11·7–15·0) in the 75 years and older group (p{$<$}0·0001). The national prevalence of valve disease, corrected for age and sex distribution from the US 2000 population, is 2·5\% (2·2–2·7). In the community group, valve disease was diagnosed in 1505 (1·8\% adjusted) adults and frequency increased considerably with age, from 0·3\% (0·2–0·3) of the 18–44 year olds to 11·7\% (11·0–12·5) of those aged 75 years and older, but was diagnosed less often in women than in men (odds ratio 0·90, 0·81–1·01; p=0·07). The adjusted mortality risk ratio associated with valve disease was 1·36 (1·15–1·62; p=0·0005) in the population and 1·75 (1·61–1·90; p{$<$}0·0001) in the community. Interpretation Moderate or severe valvular diseases are notably common in this population and increase with age. In the community, women are less often diagnosed than are men, which could indicate an important imbalance in view of the associated lower survival. Valve diseases thus represent an important public-health problem.},

We hypothesized that chordae tendineae elongation would also occur as part of this remodelling. In this study, the lengths of primary chords and measurements of mitral leaflets and annulus were compared with varying degrees of mitral regurgitation (MR).We studied 58 patients who underwent three-dimensional (3D) transoesophageal echocardiography, including 38 with FMR and 20 with normal mitral valves (NL). The FMR group was divided into two subgroups according to two-dimensional vena contracta width (VCW). Three-dimensional datasets from transgastric or mid-oesophageal approach were used to measure primary chordal length, coaptation length, inter-papillary muscle distances, and quantitative 3D measurements of the annulus and leaflets. Leaflet surface area was increased and coaptation length was decreased in FMR compared with NL. While no difference in other 3D measurement of annulus/leaflets was noted between the FMR subgroups, averaged chordal length was shorter in patients with more severe FMR. Chords of the anterior leaflet in FMR with larger VCW were shorter compared with both NL and FMR with smaller VCW. In contrast, the chords of the posterior leaflet were longer in FMR with smaller VCW compared with the other two groups.Our results suggest the posterior leaflet chords possibly remodel by elongating and contribute to reduced MR and that in a subgroup of FMR patients, the primary chords may remodel by shortening, resulting in augmented MR. This information could be useful in choosing strategy for FMR correction.},

  abstract = {Background Healthy function of tricuspid valve (TV) structures is essential to avoid tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and may significantly improve disease prognosis. Mitral valve (MV) structures have been extensively studied, but little is known about the TV and right-sided heart diseases. Therefore, clinical decisions and finite element (FE) simulations often rely heavily on MV data for TV applications, despite fundamentally different mechanical and physiological environments. Method/Results To bridge this gap, we performed a rigorous mechanical, morphological, and microstructural characterization of the MV and TV leaflets and chordae in a porcine model. Planar biaxial testing, uniaxial testing, second harmonic generation imaging and Verhoeff Van Gieson staining were performed. Morphological parameters, tissue moduli, extensibility, and anisotropy were quantified and compared. No major differences in leaflet mechanics or structure were found between TV and MV; chordal mechanics, morphology, and structure were found to compensate for anatomical and physiological loading differences between the valves. No differences in chordal mechanics were observed by insertion point within a leaflet; the septal tricuspid leaflet (STL) and posterior mitral leaflet (PML) did not have distinguishable strut chords, and the STL had the shortest chords. Within a valve, chords from septally-located leaflets were more extensible. MV chords were stiffer. Conclusions This study presents the first rigorous comparative mechanical and structural dataset of MV and TV structures. Valve type and anatomical location may be stronger predictors of chordal mechanics. Chords from septally-located leaflets differ from each other and from their intravalvular counterparts; they merit special consideration in surgical and computational applications. Statement of Significance A better understanding of the tricuspid valve (TV) and its associated structures is important for making advancements towards the repair of tricuspid regurgitation. Mitral valve structures have been extensively studied, but little is known about the TV and right-sided heart diseases. Clinical decisions and computational simulations often rely heavily on MV data for TV applications, despite fundamentally different environments. We therefore performed a rigorous mechanical, morphological, and microstructural characterization of atrioventricular leaflets and chordae tendineae in a porcine model.

  abstract = {For children born with a single functional ventricle, the Fontan operation bypasses the right ventricle by forming a four-way total cavopulmonary connection and adapts the existing ventricle for the systemic circulation. However, upon reaching adulthood, many Fontan patients exhibit low cardiac output and elevated venous pressure, eventually requiring a heart transplantation. Despite efforts in developing a new device or using an existing device for failing Fontan support, there is still no Food and Drug Administration-approved device for subpulmonary support. Penn State University is developing a hydrodynamically levitated Fontan circulatory assist device (FCAD) for bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy. The hemodynamics within the FCAD, at both steady and patient averaged pulsatile conditions for three physiological pump operating conditions, were quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV) to determine the velocity magnitudes and Reynolds normal and shear stresses within the device. Data were acquired at three planes (0\,mm and ±25\% of the radius) for the inferior and superior vena cavae inlets and the pulmonary artery outlet. The inlets had a blunt velocity profile that became skewed toward the collecting volute as fluid approached the rotor. At the outlet, regardless of the flow condition, a high-velocity jet exited the volute and moved downstream in a helical pattern. Turbulent stresses observed at the volute exit were influenced by the rotor's rotation. Regardless of inlet conditions, the pump demonstrated advantageous behavior for clinical use with a predictable flow field and a low risk of platelet adhesion and hemolysis based on calculated wall shear rates and turbulent stresses, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background Tricuspid valve imaging is frequently challenging and requires the use of multiple modalities. Knowledge of limitations and methodologic discrepancies among different imaging techniques is crucial for planning transcatheter valve interventions. Methods Thirty-eight patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation were included in this retrospective analysis. Tricuspid annulus (TA) measurements were made during mid-diastole using three-dimensional (3D) transthoracic echocardiographic direct planimetry (TTE\_direct) and transesophageal echocardiographic direct planimetry (TEE\_direct). Moreover, a semiautomated software was used to generate two-dimensional (2D) and 3D perimeter and area on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images. Both methods were compared with direct computed tomographic planimetry (CT\_direct) and cubic spline interpolation (CT\_indirect). The different TA values were used to calculate the effective regurgitant orifice area and compared with 3D Doppler vena contracta area. For tricuspid valve area TEE\_direct and CT\_direct as well as CT\_indirect were measured. Results Agreement between TEE and computed tomography (CT) for TA sizing was obtained using semiautomated methods (3D TEE\_indirect and CT\_indirect). TTE\_direct was overall less reliable compared with CT. TA area quantified by TEE\_direct was 25\% (difference 305~±~238~mm2, P~{$<~$}.001, R~=~0.9) and 19\% (166~±~247~mm2, P~{$<~$}.001, R~=~0.89) smaller compared with CT\_direct and CT\_indirect, respectively. TA perimeter measurements by TEE\_direct differed by 11\% compared with CT\_direct (12~±~11~mm, P~{$<~$}.001, R~=~0.87) and 3D CT\_indirect (12~±~11~mm, P~{$<~$}.001, R~=~0.88), and 9\% compared with 2D CT\_indirect (7~±~11~mm, P~=~.002, R~=~0.87). TEE\_direct of the TA allows the most accurate calculation of effective regurgitant orifice area compared with 3D vena contracta area (−8~±~62~mm2, P~=~.50, R~=~0.85). Tricuspid valve area by CT\_indirect best correlated with conventional TEE\_direct (80 ± 250 mm2, P = .11, R = 0.80). Conclusions In patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, semiautomated indirect planimetry results in high agreement between TEE and CT for TA sizing and measurement of the tricuspid valve area. TEE\_direct of the TA allows the most accurate measurement of diastolic stroke volume for the calculation of regurgitation severity compared with 3D vena contracta area.},

  abstract = {Numerical models of the mitral valve have been used to elucidate mitral valve function and mechanics. These models have evolved from simple two-dimensional approximations to complex three-dimensional fully coupled fluid structure interaction models. However, to date these models lack direct one-to-one experimental validation. As computational solvers vary considerably, experimental benchmark data are critically important to ensure model accuracy. In this study, a novel left heart simulator was designed specifically for the validation of numerical mitral valve models. Several distinct experimental techniques were collectively performed to resolve mitral valve geometry and hemodynamics. In particular, micro-computed tomography was used to obtain accurate and high-resolution (39~μm voxel) native valvular anatomy, which included the mitral leaflets, chordae tendinae, and papillary muscles. Three-dimensional echocardiography was used to obtain systolic leaflet geometry. Stereoscopic digital particle image velocimetry provided all three components of fluid velocity through the mitral valve, resolved every 25~ms in the cardiac cycle. A strong central filling jet (V~\textasciitilde ~0.6~m/s) was observed during peak systole with minimal out-of-plane velocities. In addition, physiologic hemodynamic boundary conditions were defined and all data were synchronously acquired through a central trigger. Finally, the simulator is a precisely controlled environment, in which flow conditions and geometry can be systematically prescribed and resultant valvular function and hemodynamics assessed. Thus, this work represents the first comprehensive database of high fidelity experimental data, critical for extensive validation of mitral valve fluid structure interaction simulations.},

This paper presents a brief review of commonly used flow assessment techniques such as Particle image velocimetry (PIV), Laser doppler velocimetry, and Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging and a comparison of these methodologies. In particular, recommendations for setting up planar PIV experiments such as recommended imaging instrumentation, acquisition and data processing are discussed in the context of heart valve flows. Multiple metrics such as residence time, local velocity and shear stress that have been identified in the literature as being relevant to hemolysis and thrombosis in heart valves are discussed. Additionally, a framework for uncertainty analysis and data reporting for PIV studies of heart valves is presented in this paper. It is anticipated that this paper will provide useful information for heart valve device manufacturers and researchers to assess heart valve flow fields for the potential for hemolysis and thrombosis.},

  abstract = {Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVIs) comprise a variety of catheter-based interventional techniques for treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients at high surgical risk and those with failed previous surgeries. Several TTVI devices with different mechanisms of action are either currently used or in preclinical evaluation. Echocardiography is the first-line modality for evaluation of tricuspid valve disease that provides information on tricuspid valve morphology, mechanism of TR, and hemodynamics. Cardiac CT and MRI have several advantages for a comprehensive preprocedure evaluation. CT and MRI provide complementary information to that of echocardiography on the mechanism and cause of TR. MRI can quantify the severity of TR using indirect or direct techniques that involve two-dimensional or four-dimensional flow sequences. MRI and CT can also accurately quantify right ventricular volumes and function, which is crucial for timing of intervention. CT provides comprehensive three-dimensional information on the morphology of the valve, annulus, subvalvular apparatus, and adjacent structures. CT is the procedure of choice for evaluation of several device-specific measurements, including tricuspid annulus dimensions, annulus-to–right coronary artery distance, leaflet morphology, coaptation gaps, caval dimensions, and cavoatrial-to–hepatic vein distance. CT allows evaluation of the vascular access as well as optimal procedure fluoroscopic angles and catheter trajectory. Postprocedure CT and MRI are useful in detection of complications such as paravalvular leak, pseudoaneurysm, thrombus, pannus, infective endocarditis, and device migration. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.}

  abstract = {Objective: Issues concerning the training and certification of surgical specialists have taken on great significance in the last decade. A realistic computer-assisted, tissue-based simulator developed for use in the training of cardiac surgical residents in the conduct of a variety of cardiac surgical procedures in a low-volume cardiothoracic surgery unit of a typical developing country is described. The simulator can also be used to demonstrate the function of technology specific to cardiac surgical procedures in a way that previously has only been possible via the conduct of a procedure on a live animal or human being. Methods: A porcine heart in a novel simulated operating theatre environment with real-time simulated haemodynamic monitoring and coronary blood flow, in arrested and beating-heart modes, is used as a training tool for surgical residents. Results: Standard and beating-heart coronary arterial bypass, aortic valve replacement, aortic homograft replacement and pulmonary autograft procedures can be simulated with high degrees of realism and with the superimposition of adverse clinical scenarios requiring valid decision making and clinical judgments to be made by the trainees. Conclusions: The cardiac surgical simulation preparation described here would appear to be able to contribute positively to the training of residents in low-volume centres, as well as having the potential for application in other settings as a training tool or clinical skills assessment or accreditation device. Collaboration with larger centres is recommended in order to accurately assess the utility of this preparation as an adjunctive cardiothoracic surgical training aid.},

  abstract = {The development of a novel artificial heart valve with outstanding durability and safety has remained a challenge since the first mechanical heart valve entered the market 65 years ago. Recent progress in high-molecular compounds opened new horizons in overcoming major drawbacks of mechanical and tissue heart valves (dysfunction and failure, tissue degradation, calcification, high immunogenic potential, and high risk of thrombosis), providing new insights into the development of an ideal artificial heart valve. Polymeric heart valves can best mimic the tissue-level mechanical behavior of the native valves. This review summarizes the evolution of polymeric heart valves and the state-of-the-art approaches to their development, fabrication, and manufacturing. The review discusses the biocompatibility and durability testing of previously investigated polymeric materials and presents the most recent developments, including the first human clinical trials of LifePolymer. New promising functional polymers, nanocomposite biomaterials, and valve designs are discussed in terms of their potential application in the development of an ideal polymeric heart valve. The superiority and inferiority of nanocomposite and hybrid materials to non-modified polymers are reported. The review proposes several concepts potentially suitable to address the above-mentioned challenges arising in the R\&D of polymeric heart valves from the properties, structure, and surface of polymeric materials. Additive manufacturing, nanotechnology, anisotropy control, machine learning, and advanced modeling tools have given the green light to set new directions for polymeric heart valves.},

There is a wealth of information about valve macro and micro structure; however, there presently is limited information on the morphology of the whole valve fiber architecture. The objective of this study was to provide qualitative and quantitative analyses of whole valve and leaflet fiber bundle branching patterns using a novel imaging system. We developed a custom automated microscope system with motor and imaging control. Whole leaflets (n = 25) were imaged at high resolution (e.g. 30,000×20,000 pixels) using elliptically polarized light to enhance contrast between structures without the need for staining or other methods. Key morphologies such as fiber bundle size and branching were measured for analyses. The left coronary leaflet displayed large asymmetry in fiber bundle organization relative to the right coronary and non-coronary leaflets. We observed and analyzed three main patterns of fiber branching; tree-like, fan-like, and pinnate structures. High resolution images and quantitative metrics are presented such as fiber bundle sizes, positions, and branching morphological parameters. To our knowledge there are currently no high resolution images of whole fresh leaflets available in the literature. The images of fiber/membrane structures and analyses presented here could be highly valuable for improving the design and development of more advanced bioprosthetic and/or bio-mimetic synthetic valve replacements.},

  abstract = {In the management of patients with valvular heart disease, an understanding of the effects of altered loading conditions on the left ventricle is important in reaching a proper decision concerning the timing of corrective operation. In acquired valvular aortic stenosis, concentric hypertrophy generally maintains left ventricular chamber size and ejection fraction within normal limits, but in late stage disease function can deteriorate as preload reserve is lost and aortic stenosis progresses. In this setting, even when the ejection fraction is markedly reduced ({$<$} 25\%), it can improve to normal after aortic valve replacement, suggesting that afterload mismatch rather than irreversibly depressed myocardial contractility was responsible for left ventricular failure. Therefore, patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms should not be denied operation because of impaired cardiac function. In chronic severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, operation is generally recommended when symptoms are present, but whether to recommend operation to prevent irreversible myocardial damage in patients with few or no symptoms has remained controversial. In aortic regurgitation, left ventricular function generally improves postoperatively, even if it is moderately impaired pre-operatively, indicating correction of afterload mismatch. Most such patients can be carefully followed by echocardiography. However, in some patients, severe left ventricular dysfunction fails to improve postoperatively. Therefore, when echocardiography studies in the patient with severe aortic regurgitation show an ejection fraction of less than 40\% (fractional shortening {$<$} 25\%) plus enlarging left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (approaching 38 mm/m2 body surface area) and end-systolic diameter (approaching 50 mm or 26 mm/m2), confirmation of these findings by cardiac catheterization and consideration of operation are advisable even in patients with minimal symptoms. In chronic mitral regurgitation, maintenance of anormal ejection fraction can mask depressed myocardial contractility. Pre- and postoperative studies in such patients have shown a poor clinical result after mitral valve replacement, associated with a sharp decrease in the ejection fraction after operation. This response appears to reflect unmasking of decreased myocardial contractility by mitral valve replacement, with ejection of the total stroke volume into the high impedance of the aorta (afterload mismatch produced by operation). Therefore, when echocardiographic studies in patients with severe mitral regurgitation show an ejection fraction of less than 55\% (fractional shortening {$<$} 30\%), an end-diastolic diameter approaching 75 mm and an end-systolic diameter approaching 2.6 mm/m2body surface area, it seems advisable to undertake operation to prevent the development of irreversible myocardial damage, even if symptoms are few or absent.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden, including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285~million)~in~1990 to 523 million (95\% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95\% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95\% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95\% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95\% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95\% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95\% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95\% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95\% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95\% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95\% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in~2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30\% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an effective minimally-invasive alternative to surgical valve replacement in medium- to high-risk, elderly patients with calcific aortic valve disease and severe aortic stenosis. The rapid growth of the TAVR devices market has led to a high variety of designs, each aiming to address persistent complications associated with TAVR valves that may hamper the anticipated expansion of TAVR utility. Areas Covered: Here we outline the challenges and the technical demands that TAVR devices need to address for achieving the desired expansion, and review design aspects of selected, latest generation, TAVR valves of both clinically-used and investigational devices. We further review in detail some of the up-to-date modeling and testing approaches for TAVR, both computationally and experimentally, and additionally discuss those as complementary approaches to the ISO 5840–3 standard. A comprehensive survey of the prior and up-to-date literature was conducted to cover the most pertaining issues and challenges that TAVR technology faces. Expert Commentary: The expansion of TAVR over SAVR and to new indications seems more promising than ever. With new challenges to come, new TAV design approaches, and materials used, are expected to emerge, and novel testing/modeling methods to be developed.},

  abstract = {Introduction Papillary muscle plays an important role in stabilizing the position of the tricuspid valve. Several pathologies can result in anatomical and functional abnormalities of the papillary muscles. The aim of the study is to deliberate the morphometry of papillary muscles in tricuspid valve and to analyze with the eminent research works previously done. Materials and methods The study was carried out in 52 formalin-fixed adult apparently normal cadaveric hearts belonging to either sex obtained from the Department of Anatomy. These hearts were dissected carefully to open the right ventricle and to expose the papillary muscles. Different morphological features of papillary muscles were noted, and measurements were taken. Result The classical picture of three papillary muscles existed in 23.07\% of the specimens. Anterior papillary muscle was in all hearts, but posterior and septal muscle was off in 15.38\% and 55.76\%, respectively. Double and triple papillary muscles were seen too. Anterior and posterior muscle appeared predominantly flat-top and arose from the middle third (mostly), while septal muscle was chiefly conical and originated basically from the upper third of the ventricular wall. Chordopapillary relationship with tricuspid valve leaflets was beyond conventional. Mean length and breadth of anterior muscle were 2.19±0.59 cm and 0.76±0.26 cm, those of posterior muscle were 1.39±0.63 cm and 0.67±0.43 cm, and those of septal papillary muscle were 0.95±0.38 cm and 0.59±0.09 cm. Conclusions Detailed knowledge of normal and variable anatomy of papillary muscles is not only necessary for better understanding of tricuspid pathologies but also valuable for successful newer surgical approaches in cardiac treatment.},

  abstract = {Managing patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) remains extremely challenging, with a lack of consensus on when and how to treat it. Tricuspid valve pathology has been disregarded for a very long time because of the established belief that treating left-sided heart diseases would lead to the resolution or significant improvement of TR. Initially considered benign, severe TR has been found to be a strong predictor of prognosis. Despite the increasing prevalence and the disabling nature of this disease, the great majority of patients with clinically significant TR have seldom been considered for structural interventions. Numerous surgical and transcatheter treatment options are now available; however, optimal timing and procedural selection remain crucial aspects influencing outcomes. According to recent evidence in the literature, early referral is associated with good short and long-term outcomes, and various predictors of favorable outcomes following either surgical or transcatheter treatment have been identified. Evaluation by a multidisciplinary heart team with expertise in tricuspid valve disease is of paramount importance to identify adequate treatment for every patient.},

  abstract = {The tricuspid valve might be of lesser importance in acquired heart disease but it often plays a primary role in congenital heart defects, especially in long-term outcomes. This chapter reviews the anatomy of the tricuspid valve, along with its embryological development. The tricuspid valve connects the right atrium and right ventricle, electrically isolates the two cardiac chambers, and maintains unidirectional blood flow. The valve complex consists of the annulus, usually three valve leaflets, the supporting chordae tendineae, and the papillary muscles. The number, length, and shape of the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles are extremely variable. This can be of clinical significance since dysfunctional papillary muscles and dysplastic chordae can be important causes of valve dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Optical flow analysis methods such as particle image velocimetry can only be performed in fluid systems or components with optical access. Many fluidic components, such as metallic tubes, do not typically feature optical accessibility. A new silicone-based molding technique is presented that makes it possible to replicate non-transparent fluidic components as models with optical accessibility that can be used to perform optical flow analysis. Furthermore, to avoid errors due to refraction, a test fluid is presented whose refractive index matches that of the silicone material of the replication. This new method allows flows to be analyzed in tubes or similar components with diameters in the range of only a few millimeters. An initial test was performed demonstrating the proof of concept and the velocity field of the flow inside a manifold was measured using a micro-particle image velocimetry setup. The study showed that both simple parts like tubes and complex parts such as manifolds can be replicated and investigated.},

  abstract = {The normal tricuspid valve anatomy and function have several dissimilarities to the corresponding mitral valve in the left heart, in part, based on lower pressures in the right heart chambers. The functional abnormalities resulting from tricuspid valve disease are classified as primary and secondary. Primary valve disease is any associated intrinsic valve pathology. The list of responsible conditions includes congenital, rheumatic, infective endocarditis, carcinoid heart disease, toxic effects of chemicals, tumors, blunt trauma, and myxomatous degeneration. The secondary tricuspid valve disease does not involve intrinsic anatomic abnormalities of the valve apparatus, aside from tricuspid annular dilation secondary to right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. The most common cause of tricuspid valve disease is secondary to left heart disease, either myocardial, valvular, or mixed. Although bedside diagnosis of advanced tricuspid valve disease is feasible, echocardiography provides valuable clues to the presence and severity of tricuspid valve stenosis and/or regurgitation with considerable accuracy. The tricuspid regurgitation signal using Doppler techniques is utilized for estimation of right ventricular systolic pressure, which, in the absence of right ventricular outflow obstruction, corresponds to pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. This is clinically useful since nearly 80 to 90\% of patients exhibit some degree of tricuspid regurgitation. The treatment of tricuspid valve disease is guided by underlying etiology and pathology. Tricuspid valve repair is increasingly advocated for patients with advanced tricuspid regurgitation, especially when combined with surgery on the left heart pathology. Primary tricuspid valve disease is often treated by surgical approach specific to the underlying pathology.},

  abstract = {Clinically available prosthetic heart valves are life-saving, but imperfect: mechanical valves requiring anticoagulation therapy, whilst bioprosthetic valves have limited durability. Polymer valves offer the prospect of good durability without the need for anticoagulation. We report the design and development of a polymeric heart valve, its bench-testing at ISO standards, and preliminary extra-vivo and in vivo short-term feasibility. Prototypes were manufactured by injection moulding of styrenic block copolymers to achieve anisotropic mechanical properties. Design was by finite element stress–strain modelling, which has been reported previously, combined with feedback from bench and surgery-based testing using various combinations of materials, valve geometry and processing conditions. Bench testing was according to ISO 5840:2015 standards using an in vitro cardiovascular hydrodynamic testing system and an accelerated fatigue tester. Bench comparisons were made with a best-in-class bio-prosthesis. Preliminary clinical feasibility evaluations included extra-vivo and short-term (1–24 hours) in vivo testing in a sheep model. The optimised final prototype met the requirements of ISO standards with hydrodynamic performance equivalent to the best-in-class bioprosthesis. Bench durability of greater than 1.2 billion cycles (30 years equivalent) was achieved (still ongoing). Extra-vivo sequential testing (n = 8) allowed refinement of external diameter, 3D shape, a low profile, flexibility, suturability, and testing of compatibility to magnetic resonance imaging and clinical sterilisation. In vivo short-term (1–24 hours) feasibility (n = 3) confirmed good suturability, no mechanical failure, no trans-valvular regurgitation, competitive trans-valvular gradients, and good biocompatibility at histopathology. We have developed and tested at ISO standards a novel prosthetic heart valve featuring competitive bench-based hydrodynamics and durability, well beyond the ISO requirements and comparable to a best-in-class bioprosthesis. In vivo short-term feasibility testing confirmed preliminary safety, functionality and biocompatibility, supporting progression to a long-term efficacy trial.},

  abstract = {The incomplete efficacy of current surgical repair procedures of the tricuspid valve (TV) demands a deeper comprehension of the physiological TV biomechanics. To this purpose, computational models can provide quantitative insight into TV biomechanical response and allow analysing the role of each TV substructure. We present here a three-dimensional finite element model of the tricuspid valve that takes into account most of its peculiar features. Experimental measurements were performed on human and porcine valves to obtain a more detailed TV anatomical framework. To overcome the complete lack of information on leaflets mechanical properties, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the adopted non-linear hyperelastic constitutive model, hypothesizing three different parameter sets for three significant collagen fibre distributions. Results showed that leaflets’ motion and maximum principal stress distribution were almost insensitive to the different material parameters considered. Highest stresses (about 100kPa) were located near the annulus of the anterior and septal leaflets, while the posterior leaflet experienced lower stresses (about 55kPa); stresses at the commissures were nearly zero. Conversely, changes in constitutive parameters deeply affected leaflets’ strains magnitude, but not their overall pattern. Strains computed assuming that TV leaflets tissue are reinforced by a sparse and loosely arranged network of collagen fibres fitted best experimental data, thus suggesting that this may be the actual microstructure of TV leaflets. In a long-term perspective, this preliminary study aims at providing a starting point for the development of a predictive tool to quantitatively evaluate TV diseases and surgical repair procedures.},

  abstract = {Background We aimed to determine the effect of a whole-heart motion-correction algorithm (new-generation snapshot freeze, NG SSF) on the image quality of cardiac computed tomography (CT) images in patients with mechanical valve prostheses compared to standard images without motion correction and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of NG SSF and standard CT image sets for the detection of prosthetic valve abnormalities. Methods A total of 20 patients with 32 mechanical valves who underwent wide-coverage detector cardiac CT with single-heartbeat acquisition were included. The CT image quality for subvalvular (below the prosthesis) and valvular regions (valve leaflets) of mechanical valves was assessed by two observers on a four-point scale (1~=~poor, 2~=~fair, 3~=~good, and 4~=~excellent). Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare image quality scores and the number of diagnostic phases (image quality score≥3) between the standard image sets and NG SSF image sets. Diagnostic performance for detection of prosthetic valve abnormalities was compared between two image sets with the final diagnosis set by re-operation or clinical findings as the standard reference. Results NG SSF image sets had better image quality scores than standard image sets for both valvular and subvalvular regions (P~{$<~$}0.05 for both). The number of phases that were of diagnostic image quality per patient was significantly greater in the NG SSF image set than standard image set for both valvular and subvalvular regions (P~{$<~$}0.0001). Diagnostic performance of NG SSF image sets for the detection of prosthetic abnormalities (20 pannus and two paravalvular leaks) was greater than that of standard image sets (P~{$<~$}0.05). Conclusion Application of NG SSF can improve CT image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with mechanical valves compared to standard images.},

  abstract = {The tricuspid valve is an atrioventricular valve that prevents blood backflow from the right ventricle into the right atrium during ventricular contractions. It is important to study mechanically induced microstructural alterations in the tricuspid valve leaflets, as this aids both in understanding valvular diseases and in the development of new engineered tissue replacements. The structure and composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) fiber networks are closely tied to an overall biomechanical function of the tricuspid valve. In this study, we conducted experiments and implemented a multiscale modeling approach to predict ECM microstructural changes to tissue-level mechanical responses in a controlled loading environment. In particular, we characterized a sample of a porcine anterior leaflet at a macroscale using a biaxial mechanical testing method. We then generated a three-dimensional finite element model, to which computational representations of corresponding fiber networks were incorporated based on properties of the microstructural architecture obtained from small angle light scattering. Using five different biaxial boundary conditions, we performed iterative simulations to obtain model parameters with an overall R2 value of 0.93. We observed that mechanical loading could markedly alter the underlying ECM architecture. For example, a relatively isotropic fiber network (with an anisotropy index value α of 28\%) became noticeably more anisotropic (with an α of 40\%) when it underwent mechanical loading. We also observed that the mechanical strain was distributed in a different manner at the ECM/fiber level as compared to the tissue level. The approach presented in this study has the potential to be implemented in pathophysiologically altered biomechanical and structural conditions and to bring insights into the mechanobiology of the tricuspid valve. Statement of Significance Quantifying abnormal cellar/ECM-level deformation of tricuspid valve leaflets subjected to a modified loading environment is of great importance, as it is believed to be linked to valvular remodeling responses. For example, developing surgical procedures or engineered tissue replacements that maintain/mimic ECM-level mechanical homeostasis could lead to more durable outcomes. To quantify leaflet deformation, we built a multiscale framework encompassing the contributions of disorganized ECM components and organized fibers, which can predict the behavior of the tricuspid valve leaflets under physiological loading conditions both at the tissue level and at the ECM level. In addition to future in-depth studies of tricuspid valve pathologies, our model can be used to characterize tissues in other valves of the heart.},

  abstract = {Introduction~           Over the years, surgical education has dramatically improved and has become increasingly innovative. Almost all educational programs in surgery now rely on sophisticated training boxes and simulators that enable surgical instruments to be handled and surgical procedures to be trained in a safe environment. However, simulators need constant feedback from supervising senior surgeons, who only have limited teaching time available. We describe a cardiac surgery simulator with an integrated supervision system for self-learning how to repair a mitral valve.           Methods~           We developed a mitral surgery simulator with integrated sensors to generate, record, and display quantitative data on trainee performance in relation with the mitral valve repair procedure. A team of experienced cardiac surgeons defined critical areas of the model and an algorithm to identify inconsistent movements, in terms of error types and out-of-bound actions. The device provided real-time feedback on the accuracy of the stitches placed. Four experienced cardiac surgeons and 3 advanced cardiac-surgery used the simulator and were asked to evaluate specific parameters of the system on a scale ranging from 1 to 10.           Results~           All surgeons completed a P2 resection, followed by implanting a 32-mm mitral ring. The simulator detected 2 stitches that were placed in dangerous zones and another stitch that was placed in an inappropriate position. Users scored the real tissue feeling and interactivity of the model 9.5/10.           Conclusions~           This heart-surgery simulator offers a real-life model for learning about and training in mitral valve surgery, which could potentially replace the experienced surgeon's teaching role.},

There can be marked variation in the anatomy of the normal tricuspid valve, which must be understood to differentiate it from pathological malformations. The tricuspid valve of 100 normal heart specimens was examined. The three leaflets of the tricuspid valve, along with the papillary muscles supporting the zones of apposition were identified, and details of the anatomy recorded and analyzed. All three leaflets were identified in all 100 hearts. The septal leaflet had tendinous cord attachments in 93 specimens to the ventricular septum. The medial papillary muscle had a single head in the majority of specimens, supporting the zone of apposition with the antero-superior leaflet in 97 specimens. The anterior papillary muscle attached to the mid-portion of the antero-superior leaflet in 62 specimens, and supplied the zone of apposition between the antero-superior and inferior leaflets in 81 specimens. There were rough zone cord attachments to the antero-superior leaflets in all specimens. The inferior leaflet had basal cord attachments in 87 specimens, with attachments to multiple small muscular heads in 37 specimens. The inferior papillary muscle was well formed in only 58 specimens. Although certain features are relatively constant, multiple variations in the normal tricuspid valve have been identified. Knowledge of these normal variations is necessary in understanding the function of this complex valve apparatus, along with the potential for pathology. Clin.

  abstract = {Simulators have been proven to equip trainee surgeons with better skills than the traditional, standard approach to skill development. The purpose of this study was to develop a low-fidelity, low-cost, reusable and portable simulation device, which could provide training in nearly the full range of mitral valve surgery techniques, in both the classic, open approach as well as the minimally invasive approach.This novel simulator is made up of commonly available components. The basic elements are a classic baby bottle, with the associated feeding teat and screw ring, in combination with a sheet of dental dam. The detailed process for making this simulator is outlined in this article. Maximum suture tensile strength on the different components was tested with a digital force gauge. Reusability and the rate of wear as a result of suturing were documented. Total cost was calculated in euros (€).This study resulted in a simulation model very similar in size to the actual anatomical dimensions of the mitral valve. Various pathological conditions, according to Carpentier's Functional Classification, could be simulated. This led to the possibility of providing training in several mitral valve surgical techniques. As the model developed, it became clear that it could also be used to practice tricuspid valve surgery techniques. Maximum mean suture tensions on the silicone teat and dental dam were 42.11 and 11.15 N/m2, respectively. The feeding teat started wearing after approximately 45 suture placements. Total cost of the study model was €5.14.This relatively simple, low-cost, low-fidelity model can provide simulation training in nearly the full range of mitral valve and tricuspid valve surgical techniques, in both the classic open approach and the minimally invasive approach—and do so almost anywhere. Especially when used by young cardiothoracic surgeons in training, this model may contribute to the development of technical skills and procedural knowledge required for adequate performance in the operating room.},

  abstract = {As catheter-based structural heart interventions become increasingly complex, the ability to effectively model patient-specific valve geometry as well as the potential interaction of an implanted device within that geometry will become increasingly important. Our aim with this investigation was to combine the technologies of high-spatial resolution cardiac imaging, image processing software, and fused multi-material 3D printing, to demonstrate that patient-specific models of the mitral valve apparatus could be created to facilitate functional evaluation of novel trans-catheter mitral valve repair strategies. Clinical 3D transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography images were acquired for three patients being evaluated for a catheter-based mitral valve repair. Target anatomies were identified, segmented and reconstructed into 3D patient-specific digital models. For each patient, the mitral valve apparatus was digitally reconstructed from a single or fused imaging data set. Using multi-material 3D printing methods, patient-specific anatomic replicas of the mitral valve were created. 3D print materials were selected based on the mechanical testing of elastomeric TangoPlus materials (Stratasys, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA) and were compared to freshly harvested porcine leaflet tissue. The effective bending modulus of healthy porcine MV tissue was significantly less than the bending modulus of TangoPlus (p~{$<~$}0.01). All TangoPlus varieties were less stiff than the maximum tensile elastic modulus of mitral valve tissue (3697.2 ± 385.8~kPa anterior leaflet; 2582.1 ± 374.2~kPa posterior leaflet) (p~{$<~$}0.01). However, the slopes of the stress-strain toe regions of the mitral valve tissues (532.8 ± 281.9~kPa anterior leaflet; 389.0 ± 156.9~kPa posterior leaflet) were not different than those of the Shore 27, Shore 35, and Shore 27 with Shore 35 blend TangoPlus material (p~{$>~$}0.95). We have demonstrated that patient-specific mitral valve models can be reconstructed from multi-modality imaging datasets and fabricated using the multi-material 3D printing technology and we provide two examples to show how catheter-based repair devices could be evaluated within specific patient 3D printed valve geometry. However, we recognize that the use of 3D printed models for the development of new therapies, or for specific procedural training has yet to be defined.},

  abstract = {Current artificial heart valves either have limited lifespan or require the recipient to be on permanent anticoagulation therapy. In this paper, effort is made to assess a newly developed bileaflet valve prosthesis made of synthetic flexible leaflet materials, whose geometry and material properties are based on those of the native mitral valve, with a view to providing superior options for mitral valve replacement. Computational analysis is employed to evaluate the geometric and material design of the valve, by investigation of its mechanical behaviour and unsteady flow characteristics. The immersed boundary (IB) method is used for the dynamic modelling of the large deformation of the valve leaflets and the fluid–structure interactions. The IB simulation is first validated for the aortic prosthesis subjected to a hydrostatic loading. The predicted displacement fields by IB are compared with those obtained using ANSYS, as well as with experimental measurements. Good quantitative agreement is obtained. Moreover, known failure regions of aortic prostheses are identified. The dynamic behaviour of the valve designs is then simulated under four physiological pulsatile flows. Experimental pressure gradients for opening and closure of the valves are in good agreement with IB predictions for all flow rates for both aortic and mitral designs. Importantly, the simulations predicted improved physiological haemodynamics for the novel mitral design. Limitation of the current IB model is also discussed. We conclude that the IB model can be developed to be an extremely effective dynamic simulation tool to aid prosthesis design.},

  abstract = {Frank’s Windkessel model described the hemodynamics of the arterial system in terms of resistance and compliance. It explained aortic pressure decay in diastole, but fell short in systole. Therefore characteristic impedance was introduced as a third element of the Windkessel model. Characteristic impedance links the lumped Windkessel to transmission phenomena (e.g., wave travel). Windkessels are used as hydraulic load for isolated hearts and in studies of the entire circulation. Furthermore, they are used to estimate total arterial compliance from pressure and flow; several of these methods are reviewed. Windkessels describe the general features of the input impedance, with physiologically interpretable parameters. Since it is a lumped model it is not suitable for the assessment of spatially distributed phenomena and aspects of wave travel, but it is a simple and fairly accurate approximation of ventricular afterload.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The prospects for a durable, athrombogenic, synthetic, flexible leaflet heart valve are enhanced by the recent availability of novel, biostable polyurethanes. As a forerunner to evaluation of such biostable valves, a prototype trileaflet polyurethane valve (utilising conventional material of known in vitro behaviour) was compared with mechanical and bioprosthetic valves for assessment of in vivo function, durability, thromboembolic potential and calcification. Methods: Polyurethane (PU), ATS bileaflet mechanical, and Carpentier–Edwards porcine (CE) valves were implanted in the mitral position of growing sheep. Counting of high-intensity transient signals (HITS) in the carotid arteries, echocardiographic assessment of valve function, and examination of blood smears for platelet aggregates were undertaken during the 6-month anticoagulant-free survival period. Valve structure and hydrodynamic performance were assessed following elective sacrifice. Results: Twenty-eight animals survived surgery (ten ATS; ten CE; eight PU). At 6 months the mechanical valve group (n=9) showed highest numbers of HITS (mean 40/h, P=0.01 cf. porcine valves), and platelet aggregates (mean 62.22/standard field), but no thromboembolism, and no structural or functional change. The bioprosthetic group (n=6) showed low HITS (1/h) and fewer aggregates (41.67, P=1.00, not significant), calcification and severe pannus overgrowth with progressive stenosis. The PU valves (n=8) showed a small degree of fibrin attachment to leaflet surfaces, no pannus overgrowth, little change in haemodynamic performance, low levels of HITS (5/h) and platelet aggregates (17.50, P≪0.01 cf. mechanical valves, P=0.23 cf. porcine valves), and no evidence of thromboembolism.Conclusions: In the absence of valve-related death and morbidity, and retention of good haemodynamic function, the PU valve was superior to the bioprosthesis; lower HITS and aggregate counts in the PU valve imply lower thrombogenicity compared with the mechanical valve. A biostable polyurethane valve could offer clinical advantage with the promise of improved durability (cf. bioprostheses) and low thrombogenicity (cf. mechanical valves).},

In this work, we present a novel framework for designing prosthetic heart valves using a parametric design platform and immersogeometric fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. We parameterize the leaflet geometry using several key design parameters. This allows for generating various perturbations of the leaflet design for the patient-specific aortic root reconstructed from the medical image data. Each design is analyzed using our hybrid arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian/immersogeometric FSI methodology, which allows us to efficiently simulate the coupling of the deforming aortic root, the parametrically designed prosthetic valves, and the surrounding blood flow under physiological conditions. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of the geometry on heart valve performance, indicated by the effective orifice area and the coaptation area. Finally, the FSI simulation result of a design that balances effective orifice area and coaptation area reasonably well is compared with patient-specific phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging data to demonstrate the qualitative similarity of the flow patterns in the ascending aorta.},

  abstract = {The hemodynamics in the aorta as well as the durability of aortic valve prostheses vary greatly between different types of devices. Although placement and sizing of surgical aortic valve prostheses are excellent, the valve geometry of common devices cannot be customized to fit the patient’s anatomy perfectly. Similarly, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) devices are not customizable and may be orientated unfavorably during implantation. Imperfect fit of an aortic valve prosthesis may result in suboptimal performance and in some cases the need for additional surgery. Leveraging the advent of precision, multi-material 3D-printing, a bioinspired silicone aortic valve was developed. The manufacturing technique makes it fully customizable and significantly cheaper to develop and produce than common prostheses. In this study, we assess the hemodynamic performance of such a 3D-printed aortic valve and compare it to two TAVI devices as well as to a severely stenosed valve. We investigate the blood flow distal to the valve in an anatomically accurate, compliant aorta model via three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry measurements. Our results demonstrate that the 3D-printed aortic valve induces flow patterns and topology compatible with the TAVI valves and showing similarity to healthy aortic blood flow. Compared to the stenosis, the 3D-printed aortic valve reduces turbulent kinetic energy levels and irreversible energy losses by over 75\%, reaching values compatible with healthy subjects and conventional TAVIs. Our study substantiates that the 3D-printed heart valve displays a hemodynamic performance similar to established devices and underscores its potential for driving innovation towards patient specific valve prostheses.},

  abstract = {With an increasing number of patients requiring valve replacement, there is heightened interest in advancing heart valve tissue engineering (HVTE) to provide solutions to the many limitations of current surgical treatments. A variety of materials have been developed as scaffolds for HVTE including natural polymers, synthetic polymers, and decellularized valvular matrices. Among them, biocompatible hydrogels are generating growing interest. Natural hydrogels, such as collagen and fibrin, generally show good bioactivity, but poor mechanical durability. Synthetic hydrogels, on the other hand, have tunable mechanical properties; however, appropriate cell-matrix interactions are difficult to obtain. Moreover, hydrogels can be used as cell carriers when the cellular component is seeded into the polymer meshes or decellularized valve scaffolds. In this review, we discuss current research strategies for HVTE with an emphasis on hydrogel applications. The physicochemical properties and fabrication methods of these hydrogels, as well as their mechanical properties and bioactivities are described. Performance of some hydrogels including in vitro evaluation using bioreactors and in vivo tests in different animal models are also discussed. For future HVTE, it will be compelling to examine how hydrogels can be constructed from composite materials to replicate mechanical properties and mimic biological functions of the native heart valve.},

Modeling and simulation of heart valves dynamics is a challenging biomechanical problem. Many researchers have taken various approaches to model the heart valve. But systematical categorization and development tendency of their research have never been discussed before. This paper reviews their models and divides them into wet models or dry models, in the light of whether considering blood flow and valve interaction.

  abstract = {Polymeric heart valves (PHVs) are a promising and more affordable alternative to mechanical heart valves (MHVs) and bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs). Materials with good durability and biocompatibility used for PHVs have always been the research focus in the field of prosthetic heart valves for many years, and leaflet thickness is a major design parameter for PHVs. The study aims to discuss the relationship between material properties and valve thickness, provided that the basic functions of PHVs are qualified. The fluid−structure interaction (FSI) approach was employed to obtain a more reliable solution of the effective orifice area (EOA), regurgitant fraction (RF), and stress and strain distribution of the valves with different thicknesses under three materials: Carbothane PC−3585A, xSIBS and SIBS−CNTs. This study demonstrates that the smaller elastic modulus of Carbothane PC−3585A allowed for a thicker valve ({$>$}0.3 mm) to be produced, while for materials with an elastic modulus higher than that of xSIBS (2.8 MPa), a thickness less than 0.2 mm would be a good attempt to meet the RF standard. What is more, when the elastic modulus is higher than 23.9 MPa, the thickness of the PHV is recommended to be 0.l–0.15 mm. Reducing the RF is one of the directions of PHV optimization in the future. Reducing the thickness and improving other design parameters are reliable means to reduce the RF for materials with high and low elastic modulus, respectively.},

  abstract = {Surgical simulation is becoming increasingly important in training cardiac surgeons. However, there are currently no training simulators capable of testing the quality of simulated heart valve procedures under dynamic physiologic conditions. Here we describe a dynamic ventricular simulator, consisting of a 3D printed valve suspension chamber and a model 1423 Harvard apparatus pulsatile pump, which can provide close to physiologic hemodynamic perfusion of porcine aortic roots attached to the valve chamber for education and training in cardiac surgery. The simulator was validated by using it to test aortic valve leaflet repairs (n = 6) and aortic valve replacements (n = 3) that were performed by two trainees. Procedural success could be evaluated by direct visualization of the opening and closing valve, hemodynamic measurements and echocardiography. We conclude that, unlike other methods of simulation, this novel ventricular simulator is able to test the functional efficacy of aortic procedures under dynamic physiologic conditions using clinically relevant echocardiographic and hemodynamic outcomes. While validated for valve surgery, other potential applications include ascending aortic interventions, coronary re-implantation or catheter-based valve replacements.},
