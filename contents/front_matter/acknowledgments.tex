% ``There is so much drama in the PhD''.
% Excuse me, Snoop for crippling your words, but I could not find anything better$\ldots$ or maybe ``one does not simply defend a phd thesis'' (Excuse me, Boromir).
% This thesis work is just the emerged part of an iceberg, floating of an ocean of people (sorry for the cheesy metaphor).
% Without their technical and emotional support, this thesis would probably not exist.
% Fortunately, I was followed and accompanied by a committee of people, each entering the stage just at the right time.
