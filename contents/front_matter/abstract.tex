scene analysis aims at retrieving useful information from microphone recordings.
Examples of these problems are sound source separation and sound source localization, where we are interested in estimating the content and location


\newthought{This thesis} highlights the difficulty of getting beeches
% Finally, we want to underline the difficulty related to the tasks of estimating and exploiting acoustic echoes to improve indoor audio processing.
% Therefore, this thesis consists only of a first attempting work that lays analytical foundations on how to model such problems, and it can serve as a starting point for new exciting directions.
